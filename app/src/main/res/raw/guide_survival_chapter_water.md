<!-- K: water, thirst, thirsty, drink -->
<!-- S: Stay hydrated and purify water. -->

You can only survive a few days without water in most cases, and sometimes not even that long. Knowing how to find and purify water is vital in a survival situation.

## Be prepared
<!-- K: prepare, gear, knowledge, skill, container, filter, sheet, tarp, tablet -->
<!-- S: Bring extra water, a water container, and purification method. Learn how to locate water sources and purify water. -->

### Gear

**Necessities**:
- Water (enough for the duration of your trip, plus a bit extra).
  - Bring a water purification method for longer trips and plan your route to include water sources.
- Water containers (ensure you have a container that you can boil water in).

**Optional**:
- Water purification method (tablets or filter)
- Cooking pot or container
- Clear plastic sheet/tarp

### Knowledge and skills
Start by learning how to do the following:
- Plan your water needs for the trip
- Locate water sources
- Purify water by boiling

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Purify water using chemical treatment or filtration
- Collect water from plants and other sources
- Collect water using a solar still
- Boil water using hot rocks
- Desalinate water

## Hydration essentials
<!-- K: hydration, essential, daily, dehydration -->
<!-- S: Drink at least 2 to 3 quarts/liters of water daily. Recognize the signs of dehydration. -->

Assume all surface water is contaminated and requires purification, and if you have to choose a water source, try to find running water. To avoid getting sick or becoming dehydrated quickly, avoid drinking alcohol, saltwater, stagnant water, urine, or eating snow.

At 70°F (20°C), you will need around 2 to 3 quarts/liters of water daily. This amount increases with physical activity and exposure to higher temperatures.

### Dehydration

Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluids than it takes in. Symptoms include thirst, dry mouth and throat, fatigue, dizziness, dark urine, reduced urine output, dry skin, headache, and confusion.

## Finding water
<!-- K: find, source, collect, plant, solar-still, solar, still, dew, rain, river, groundwater, sea, ice, bamboo, coconut, dig, hole, snow, rainwater, desert, beach, ocean, salt, transpiration -->
<!-- S: Find water from streams, snow, rain, dew, or groundwater. Purify all water before drinking. -->

You can find water in many places if you know where to look. Unless otherwise stated, you should purify all water that you collect.

### Precipitation

Rainwater collected directly in containers does not need purification, but it should be purified if it has touched another surface. Snow and ice should be melted using a fire or body heat before drinking; eating it directly can lower your core body temperature.

### Bodies of water

Flowing water from rivers or streams is typically safer than lakes, ponds, and stagnant water. Saltwater can be put into a solar still to remove the salt and should never be consumed directly.

### Groundwater

Water is available in many places by just digging a hole in the ground and allowing water to seep in. You can find groundwater in dry environments by looking for green vegetation, valleys, low areas, or dry riverbeds.

### Plants

Plants can provide water when no open sources are available. Look for green bamboo, vines, or coconuts for easy access to water, but be sure to positively identify the plant before consuming. You can extract water from other plants by placing them into a solar still.

Dew can be collected from plants in the early morning using a cloth to soak up the water.

### Solar stills

**Below-ground solar still**

A below-ground solar still is a simple device that uses the sun's heat to draw moisture from the soil or plants. The moisture then condenses on a plastic sheet and can be collected in a container.

1. Dig a bowl-shaped hole about 3 feet (1 meter) across and 2 feet (0.6 meters) deep. Ensure it is in direct sunlight.
2. Place a container in the center of the hole. Optionally, place plants or water around the container to increase moisture (do not place them in the container).
3. Place a plastic sheet over the hole, securing the edges with rocks or soil. You can use a clear bag if you don't have a sheet.
4. Place a small rock in the center of the sheet directly over the container.
5. Wait for the sun to heat the ground and evaporate moisture, which will condense on the plastic and drip into the container.

**Transpiration bag**

A transpiration bag is a plastic bag tied around a leafy branch to collect water.

1. Tie a plastic bag around a leafy branch, ensuring that the bag is airtight.
2. Wait for the sun to heat the plant, causing moisture to evaporate and condense on the bag.
3. Collect the water that has condensed inside the bag.

## Making water safe to drink
<!-- K: make, safe, purify, boil, purification, chemical, filter, filtration, treat, bacteria, virus, parasite, stagnant, technique -->
<!-- S: Always purify water before drinking. Boil water for 1 - 3 minutes, use purification tablets, or filter it. -->

Always ensure the water you collect is safe to drink. Boiling is the most reliable method, but chemical purification tablets and filters are also effective. If you cannot purify the water immediately, prioritize finding and storing water until you can treat it.

### Boiling

Bring water to a rolling boil for at least one minute. At higher altitudes, boil for three minutes. If you do not have a single-walled metal container that can be used for boiling, then do the following:
1. Find another container, dig a hole in the ground and line it with a waterproof material, or craft a bowl.
2. Fill the container with water.
3. Heat rocks in a fire and place them in the water to heat it. **Do not** use rocks that may contain moisture (such as river rocks), as they can explode. Use two sticks in a chopstick fashion to move the rocks.
4. Replace the rocks with hot ones to keep the water boiling.

### Filtration

Use a portable water filter to remove contaminants. Some filters are rated to remove nearly all bacteria and viruses and can be used without additional purification. If you do not have a filter, you can construct one to remove sediment, but you must also purify the water through boiling or chemical treatment. A filter can be built by layering grass or small rocks, sand, and charcoal (from top to bottom) in a container with a hole at the bottom to collect the filtered water.

### Chemical treatment

You can buy chemical water purification tablets or drops. Use them according to the instructions, which will typically involve adding them to water and letting it sit for a while.

### Hazards

Water may contain bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause illness. Boiling water kills most microorganisms, but some may require additional treatment. Microorganisms are more likely to be present in stagnant water.

Water may contain chemicals from industrial or agricultural runoff. Purification methods may not remove all chemical contaminants. Avoid drinking water next to roads, farms, or other inhabited areas.

## Craft: Bowl
<!-- K: bowl, cook, store, container -->
<!-- S: You can make a bowl from a small log by burning a bowl shape into it using hot coals. -->

A wooden bowl can be used to boil water using hot rocks.

**Resources**
- A small log (not decayed)
- Hot coals

**Instructions**
1. Cut or obtain a small log.
2. Place hot coals into the log using makeshift tongs.
3. Let the coals burn out.
4. Scrape out the charred wood with a stick or rock.
5. Repeat the process until you have a bowl.

## Craft: Tongs
<!-- K: tongs, craft -->
<!-- S: You can make tongs from green wood. -->

You can use tongs to move around hot coals or rocks without getting burned.

**Resources**
- Green wood

**Instructions**
1. Cut a length of green wood.
2. Split the wood down the middle to create a flat surface.
3. Optionally, carve a small notch in the stick's center to allow it to bend more easily.
4. Bend the wood in half to create tongs.
