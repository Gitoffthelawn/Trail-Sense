The Signal Finder tool helps you find a place where you will have cell signal.

## Signals
Signals that your phone detects are displayed at the top of the list. You will see the following information:

- Network type
- Signal strength
- The time that the signal was detected
- Whether you have full service or only emergency calls. Full service means the tower is for your provider.

## Cell towers
A list of nearby cell towers is displayed at the bottom of the list. These are approximate tower locations from the OpenCelliD project and are within a couple miles or kilometers of the cell tower. You will see the following information:

- Network type
- Distance from your location
- Direction from your location

You will also have the ability to navigate to or create a beacon for the tower by using the menu on the right side.

## Emergency calls
You should be able to place an emergency call as long as you have cell signal from any provider.

## Disclaimer
The accuracy of the tower locations may vary, and some towers may have been decomissioned or are inaccurate.
