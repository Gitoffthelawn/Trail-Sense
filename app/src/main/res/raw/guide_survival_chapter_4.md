## Food essentials
Most people can survive for weeks without food, but it may take days or weeks to find a reliable food source. Without adequate food, the body and mind weaken, making it difficult to perform essential tasks.

### Caloric and nutritional needs
The average person needs 2,000 calories per day. You should aim to balance carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in your diet.

- **Carbohydrates**: Provides an immediate source of energy and are found in grains, fruits, and vegetables. Aim for 45-65% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Fats**: Provides long-term energy and are used in essential bodily functions. They are found in meats, oils, nuts, and seeds. Aim for 20-35% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Proteins**: Builds and repairs tissues and are found in meats, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
- **Vitamins and minerals**: Essential for overall health and are found in most foods, but a varied diet is necessary to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients.

### Storage
Food should be stored in airtight containers to prevent spoilage and contamination. Do not pack foods that spoil quickly or require refrigeration.

### Rationing


### Starvation
Starvation occurs when the body does not receive enough nutrients to function properly. Symptoms include:
- Loss of body fat.
- Difficulty breathing.
- Lower body temperature.
- Reduced muscle mass.
- Fatigue.
- Longer healing time for wounds and illnesses.

Unless you are absolutely certain of a mushroom's safety, do not eat it. Many mushrooms are poisonous and can cause severe illness or death.

### Insects
Insects are a good source of protein, but need to be gathered in large numbers to provide a substantial meal.

Do not eat the following insects:
- Biting or stinging insects.
- Hairy or brightly colored insects.
- Insects with a pungent odor.
- Hairy caterpillars.
- Spiders.
- Ticks.
- Flies.
- Mosquitoes.

Common edible insects include:
- Ants and termites.
- Locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets.
- Dragonflies.
- Bee or wasp larvae.
- Warms and grubs.

Many flying insects can be attracted to a light source at night, making them easier to catch.

Cook all insects before eating to kill any parasites or bacteria.
