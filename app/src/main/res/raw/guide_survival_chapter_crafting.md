## Be prepared

### Gear

**Necessities**:
- Knife
- Cordage (paracord)
- Sewing kit (needle and thread)

**Optional**:
- Axe
- Saw
- Metal container with a lid

### Knowledge and skills

Start by learning how to do the following:
- Tie several types of knots.
- Sew and repair clothing.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Use wood to make tools, containers, and other items.
- Make cordage, charcoal, and pitch.
- Sharpen tools and knives.
- Construct various crafted items (as covered in this chapter).

## Woodworking

### Cutting wood
In the majority of cases, use fallen wood. If you need to trim the wood to a specific size, break it by hand or foot. To break a larger piece of wood, you can insert it between two live trees at the point you want to break it and push it to the side until it snaps.

A saw or axe can also be used to cut wood. Be sure to cut away from your body and use proper technique.

### Stop cuts
Stop cuts are used to prevent wood from splitting when you are cutting it. To make a stop cut, make a small cut perpendicular to the grain of the wood where you want to stop the cut. This cut should be about 1/3 of the way through the wood. You can baton the knife to form a stop cut.

### Batoning wood
Batoning is the process of using a knife to split wood. To baton wood, place the knife on the wood where you want to split it and hit the back of the knife with a piece of wood. Be sure to use a knife with a full tang and a fixed blade.

## Sharpening
If you find a smooth rock, you can use it to sharpen your knife or axe. Preferably the rock will be small enough to hold in your hand. To sharpen your tool, rub the rock in a circular motion along the edge of the blade. Be sure to match the angle of the blade when sharpening.

## Knives

### Bone knife

**Resources**
- Large bone
- Rock with a coarse surface

**Instructions**
1. Break off a large shard of the bone. You can do this by hitting the bone with a rock. You may want to use a sharp rock to make a groove in the bone that is the shape you want the knife to be prior to breaking it.
2. Grind an edge onto the shard using a rock with a coarse surface.

### Stone knife

**Resources**
- Flint, chert, or obsidian
- A second rock

**Instructions**
Break off a shard of the flint/chert/obsidian by hitting the edge with another rock using a glancing blow. This shard will likely have a sharp edge, if it does not, break off another shard and try again.

## Compasses

**Resources**
- Needle
- Knife
- Leaf or bottle cap
- Water

**Instructions**
1. Magnetize the needle by stroking it with the knife in one direction (to avoid dulling the blade, use the back of the knife). Stroke at least 50 times.
2. Place the needle on the leaf/cap and float it in water. The needle will slowly align to the north-south axis. Ensure there are no currents or wind that could affect the needle.

## Fishhooks
- **Wooden hooks**: Cut a piece of hardwood, put a notch in one end and secure a sharp object into the notch using cordage.
- **Gorge hooks**: Carve a piece of wood or bone into the shape shown in the picture below. Tie a line to the middle of the hook and place into bait. When the fish swallows the bait, the hook will lodge in its throat - you do not need to pull the line to set the hook.
- **Other hooks**: You can use metal wire or thorns as hooks. See the picture below.

## Tongs

**Resources**
- Green wood

**Instructions**
1. Cut a length of green wood.
2. Split the wood down the middle to create a flat surface.
3. Optionally, carve a small notch in the center of the stick to allow it to bend more easily.
4. Bend the wood in half to create tongs.

## Bowls
Bowls can be used for cooking, eating, and storing food.

**Resources**
- A small log (not decayed)
- Hot coals

**Instructions**
1. Cut or obtain a small log.
2. Using makeshift tongs, place hot coals into the log.
3. Let the coals burn out.
4. Scrape out the charred wood with a stick or rock.
5. Repeat the process until you have a bowl.

## Charcoal
Charcoal is made by burning wood in a low-oxygen environment. It can be used for filtering water, making pitch, medicine, and as fuel for fires. You can grind charcoal into powder by placing it in a container and crushing it with a stick or rock.

### Container method

**Resources**
- Wood
- Metal container with a lid

**Instructions**
1. Fill a metal container with wood.
2. Cover the container with a lid, ensuring there is a small gap or hole in the lid.
3. Place the container on a fire, smoke will come out of the hole.
4. When the smoke stops, remove the container from the fire and let it cool. For best results, flip the container upside down or cover the hole.

### Extinguishing method

**Resources**
- Wood
- Water or dirt

**Instructions**
1. Burn a fire down to coals.
2. Douse the fire with water or dirt to quickly extinguish it.
3. Wait for the coals to cool, there should be some charcoal among the ashes.

## Pitch (glue)
Pitch is a natural glue made from tree resin. It can be used to repair tools, make waterproof containers, and as a fire starter.

**Resources**
- 2 parts tree resin (pine, spruce, or fir), preferably hardened chunks
- 1 part ground charcoal
- 1 part ground organic material (dried bark/leaves, sawdust, deer/moose droppings, animal fat, or wax)
- Container or a rock with a depression
- Stick or bone for stirring

**Instructions**
1. Melt the resin in a container over a fire. Be careful not to burn it.
2. Remove from heat.
3. Stir in the charcoal and organic material.
4. You can either let it cool in the container or continue to step 5.
5. Dip the end of a stick into the pitch to coat it.
6. Remove the stick and let the pitch cool, ensuring it forms an even coat.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have a thick layer of pitch on the stick, it should look like a large matchstick.

**Usage**
1. Melt the pitch in a container over a fire.
2. Apply the pitch to the object you want to repair, as you would with glue.
3. Let the pitch cool and harden.

## Cordage

### Twine
Twine is made by twisting fibers together. It is weaker than rope but can be used for sewing, fishing line, or light-duty cordage.

**Resources**

Any fibrous material can be used to make cordage. Some examples include:
- Grasses and sedges (sedges are stronger)
- Bark or palm fiber

**Instructions**
1. Gather the fibers into a loose bundle.
2. Hold the bundle near the center and twist one side clockwise until a kink forms.
3. Fold the bundle in half at the kink.
4. Twist the top half clockwise.
5. Twist the two halves together counterclockwise.
6. Repeat the process until you have a full strand. If a material is running out, add more material to it and twist it in.

### Rope
Rope is made by braiding multiple strands of twine together. It is stronger than twine and can be used for heavier tasks.

**Resources**
- 3 or more strands of twine
- A small strand, tape, or pitch

**Instructions**
1. Lay the strands parallel to each other.
2. Cross the right strand over the center strand and under the left strand.
3. Repeat the process with the new rightmost strand.
4. Once you reach the ends, you can whip the ends or coat them with pitch to prevent unraveling. See the knots section for more information on whipping.
5. You can repeat this process using ropes instead of twine to make even stronger rope.

## Knots

### Overhand knot
Used to prevent the end of a rope from untwisting.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/120.webp)

### Round turn and two half hitches
Used to anchor rope to a pole or tree.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/121.webp)

### Figure-eight knot
Used to form a larger knot than would be formed by an overhand knot at the end of a rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/122.webp)

### Square knot
Used for tying two ropes of equal diameter together. Be sure to tie a true square knot to prevent slipping, if you reverse the procedure, the knot will slip under strain.

Untie by grasping the bends of the two bights and pulling the knot apart.

### Single sheet bend
Used for tying two ropes of unequal diameter together. This knot will draw tight under light loads but may loosen or slip when the tension is released.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/124.webp)

### Double sheet bend
Used for tying two ropes of unequal diameter together. This knot will not slip or draw tight under heavy loads.

### Bowline on a bight
Useful for forming a loop at some point in a rope other than at the end.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/127.webp)

### French bowline
Used as a sling for lifting people. If used in this manner, one loop is used around the body under the arms.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/128.webp)

### Two half hitches
Used to tie a rope to a timber or pole. The single half hitch is not very secure without load, so use an overhand or the two half hitches instead.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/130.webp)

### Timber hitch
Used for moving heavy timbers or poles. You can make a tighter hold on heavy poles for lifting or dragging by combining a timber hitch and half hitch.

### Clove hitch
Used to fasten a rope to a timber, pipe, or post. It can be tied at any point in a rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/133.webp)

### Sheepshank
Used to shorten a rope or take the load off a weak spot in the rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/134.webp)

### Prussic
Used to tie a short rope around a longer rope in such a manner that the short rope will slide on the other rope if no tension is applied, and will hold if tension is applied on the short rope.
