Fire is a crucial survival tool in the wilderness, providing warmth, a means to cook food, a way to signal for help, and much more. This guide will help you understand the essentials of firecraft, including how to prepare a fire site, select materials, and utilize various methods to start and maintain a fire effectively.

## Understanding fire

**Key functions of fire:**

- **Warmth**: Reduces the energy your body needs to stay warm.
- **Signaling**: Can be used to signal for help with smoke and light.
- **Water purification**: Boiling water is a reliable method to make it safe for drinking.
- **Cooking and preserving food**: Cooks food and can be used to smoke and preserve it.
- **Drying clothes**: Helps in drying wet clothing and gear.
- **Repelling wildlife**: Smoke can deter mosquitoes and other dangerous animals.
- **Boosting morale**: Offers psychological comfort and a sense of security.
- **Sterilizing tools**: Heat can be used to sterilize tools and equipment.
- **Charcoal**: Can be used for filtering water, medicinal purposes, or as a writing implement.

**Principles of fire**: 

Fire needs three things to burn: heat, fuel, and oxygen. This is known as the fire triangle. Removing one of these elements will extinguish the fire.

## Building a fire

### Preparing a fire site
- **Location**: Choose a flat, dry area protected from the wind, close to your shelter and a fuel supply.
- **Preparation**: Clear the ground to expose soil and remove any flammable materials to prevent unintended spreading. If in snowy conditions, use a platform of green logs to build the fire on.

### Fire reflector (optional)
A fire reflector is a wall built behind the fire to reflect heat towards you and protect the fire from wind. Use rocks, logs, or snow to build a barrier. It is easier to build a reflector before starting the fire.

### Gathering materials

- **Tinder**: Dry, fine materials that catch fire easily. You can dry out damp tinder by placing it near your body or in your sleeping bag.
  - Shredded inner bark (birch, cedar, chestnut, red elm)
  - Fine wood scrapings or shavings
  - Dry grass, leaves, or pine needles
  - Dry powdered sap from pine trees
  - Crushed fibers from dead plants
  - Seed down (cattail, milkweed, thistle)
  - Feather sticks (wood shavings attached to a stick)
  - Commercial fire starters
  - Cotton balls (preferably soaked in petroleum jelly)
  - Lint
  - Paper
  - Charcloth (see below)
- **Kindling**: Small sticks and twigs that catch fire from the tinder and help build the flame.
  - Sticks and twigs (pencil to finger thickness)
  - Thinly split wood
  - Plastics, such as straws or spoons
  - Wood soaked in a flammable liquid such as bug spray (use caution)
- **Fuel**: Larger pieces of wood that will burn longer and sustain your fire.

### Fire structures

- **Tepee**: Start with a tinder bundle and build a cone of kindling around it. This structure is easy to light and good for heating. This fire burns well with even wet wood.
- **Lean-to**: Place a long green stick in the ground at an angle, leaning kindling against it. Place tinder underneath the lean-to.
- **Cross-ditch**: Dig an X in the ground and place tinder in the center. Build a kindling pyramid over the tinder. The ditch allows air to flow under the fire.
- **Pyramid**: Lay small logs or branches in parallel on the ground to form a platform. Build additional layers in a crisscross pattern, leaving space for air to circulate. Start the fire at the top of the pyramid. This fire requires less attention.

## Starting a fire

- **Matches/lighters**: Always have waterproof matches or a reliable lighter in your kit.
- **Fire steel**: Durable and works in all weather conditions, producing sparks to ignite your tinder.
- **Magnifying glass / lens**: Focus sunlight through a lens onto tinder to create a fire. Glasses or even a clear bottle filled with water can work.

- **Flint and steel**: Strike a flint rock with a steel tool to create sparks. The tinder must be very dry and fine.
- **Bow drill**: Create friction by spinning a stick (drill) on a wooden base (fireboard) using a bow to rotate the drill.
- **Hand drill**: Similar to the bow drill but uses hand power to spin the drill.

### Making a bow drill
- **Socket**: A small, flat stone or piece of hardwood to hold the drill in place. It should have a small depression to fit the top of the drill.
- **Drill**: A straight, dry stick about 10 - 12 inches long and 3/4 inches in diameter.
- **Fireboard**: A flat piece of dry wood with a notch cut into it to collect the ember. Soft wood such as yucca, tamarack, aspen, balsam fir, basswood, poplar, cypress, cottonwood, alder, red cedar, and willow are preferred. Cut a depression about 1/2 to 3/4 inches from the edge of one side. On the underside of the board, make a V-shaped cut from the edge of the board to the depression. Avoid resinous woods like pine.
- **Bow**: A flexible, curved stick with a cord attached to both ends. The cord should be wrapped around the drill. A shoelace can be used as the cord.
- **Fire pan**: A flat piece of bark or wood to catch the ember.

To operate, place the fireboard on the fire pan, hold the drill upright in the depression, and use the bow to spin the drill. The friction will create an ember that can be transferred to your tinder bundle. Place a foot on the fireboard to hold it steady.

## Maintaining and extinguishing a fire

**Maintaining**: Keep adding fuel to maintain your fire. Adjust the structure as needed to control the burn rate and heat distribution.

**Extinguishing**: Thoroughly extinguish your fire by dousing it with water or covering it with dirt. Make sure no embers remain that could reignite or cause a wildfire. If on a beach, do not cover the fire with sand, as it can insulate the heat and cause burns.

**Safety Tips**:

- Never leave a fire unattended.
- Be aware of local fire regulations and conditions.
- Always have a plan to extinguish the fire quickly if needed.

### Moving the fire

**Fire bundle**

A fire bundle is a portable fire that can be carried to a new location. It is made by wrapping a burning ember/coals in a bundle of dry punk wood, damp plant matter, and contained in bark. This allows you to transport a fire without needing to start a new one from scratch.

**Charcloth**

Charcloth is a material used to easily catch a spark and ignite a fire. It is made by charring natural fibers in a low-oxygen environment. To make charcloth:

1. Cut a piece of natural fabric (cotton, linen, or jute) into small squares.
2. Place the fabric squares in a metal tin with a small hole in the lid.
3. Heat the tin over a fire until smoke stops coming out of the hole.
4. Remove the tin from the fire and let it cool.
