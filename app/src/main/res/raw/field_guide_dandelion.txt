Dandelion
A common plant with yellow flowers and deeply toothed leaves, found in lawns, fields, and roadsides. All parts are edible, but the leaves are bitter when mature. Dandelions have potential to help with constipation or inflammation. They are also a diuretic, which could lead to an increased risk of dehydration.
