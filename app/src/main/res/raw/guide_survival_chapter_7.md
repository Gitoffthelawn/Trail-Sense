Navigating and moving efficiently is crucial for safety, energy conservation, and increasing the chances of successful recovery or reaching your destination. This guide discusses essential considerations and techniques for land navigation and decision-making in various environments.

## Deciding whether to move or stay put

When deciding whether to stay put or move, consider the following factors:

- **Safety and security**: Assess any threats, including natural and human factors that might compromise safety.
- **Resource availability**: Ensure the location has or is near essential resources like water and shelter.
- **Health and capability**: Evaluate physical and mental health; avoid travel if injured or not mentally prepared.
- **Environmental conditions**: Environmental conditions that might impact movement, such as extreme weather or terrain.
- **Recovery likelihood**: Stay put if recovery is likely soon; move if it improves the chances of rescue or meeting basic needs.

## Movement

Proper movement techniques can help conserve energy and maintain speed:

- **Posture and balance**: Keep your body weight balanced over your feet. Use a flat-footed stance to maintain stability.
- **Terrain navigation**: Adjust your movement to the terrain. Use zigzag paths on steep slopes and maintain a bend in your knees when descending to protect your joints.
- **Environmental awareness**: Be aware of natural paths like animal trails which can offer easier travel and potential resources like water.
- **Planning**: Study the terrain and plan your route in advance. Camp early to ensure enough time for shelter construction.

### Environments

**Mountainous / cold**

Consider the following when moving in mountainous or cold environments:

- **Avalanche risk**: Avoid areas prone to avalanches and be cautious when crossing snow-covered slopes.
- **Altitude sickness**: Acclimate to high altitudes to avoid altitude sickness symptoms like headaches, nausea, and fatigue.
- **Wind chill**: Protect against wind chill by wearing appropriate clothing and taking shelter when necessary.
- **Snow travel**: Use snowshoes or skis for easier travel in snowy conditions. Test ice and snow conditions using a pole or stick before stepping.
- **Frozen water**: Avoid walking on frozen water bodies unless you are sure of the ice thickness.

**Desert**

Consider the following when moving in desert environments:

- **Hydration**: Conserve water by traveling during cooler hours and wearing appropriate clothing to reduce sweating.
- **Salt marshes**: Avoid salt marshes, as they can be dangerous and difficult to navigate.
- **Temperature shifts**: Be prepared for temperature shifts between day and night. Wear appropriate clothing to protect against sun exposure and cold nights.
- **Electronics**: Protect electronic devices from extreme heat and direct sunlight.
- **Shadows**: Stick to the shadows to avoid direct sun exposure and reduce the risk of heat exhaustion.
- **Distance**: Distance can be deceiving in the desert (paths look shorter than they actually are); plan your route carefully and carry enough water and supplies.

**Jungle**

Consider the following when moving in jungle environments:

- **Recovery**: It will be harder to find you under a dense canopy.
- **Vegetation**: Move your body with the vegetation rather than fighting against it to reduce energy expenditure.
- **Navigation**: Do not focus on near objects; look for landmarks in the distance to maintain direction.
- **Insects**: Wear protective clothing to avoid insect bites and stings.
- **Wounds**: Treat any wounds and scratches promptly to avoid infection.

### Crossing water

- **Assessment**: Look for the narrowest part of the river or a place where it breaks into several channels.
- **Precautions**: Avoid crossing at areas with strong currents or near ledges that indicate rapids.

## Navigation

It is important to familiarize yourself with the terrain and use prominent features as landmarks. Although GPS devices are useful, it is essential to know how to navigate without them using a map and compass. In a pinch, you could use the sun and shadows to determine direction.
