- Descend to a lower altitude if symptoms are severe or do not improve within a day.

### Prevention
- Ascend slowly.
- Acclimate to the altitude before ascending further.
- Look out for symptoms if traveling above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).

## Bites / attacks: mammals and other animals
<!-- K: bite, attack, animal, mammal, bell, fight, pepper-spray, bear -->
<!-- S: Treat by washing the wound with soap and water, applying anitibiotics, bandaging, and seeking medical attention. Prevent by avoiding wild animals and making noise to alert them of your presence. -->

Many animals bite when they feel threatened or cornered. Some animals can transmit diseases through their bites.

### Treatment
1. Wash the wound with soap and water.
2. Apply antibiotic ointment.
3. Cover the wound with a bandage. Pack the wound with gauze if it is deep, but do not suture or tape it closed.
4. Seek medical attention if the wound is deep, bleeding, or shows signs of infection.

If you were bitten by a mammal, seek medical attention as soon as possible. You may need rabies shots.

### Prevention
- Do not approach or corner wild animals.
- Do not feed wild animals.
- Use a bear bell or make noise to alert animals of your presence.
- Stay clear of any animal with young nearby.
- If an animal is approaching you (most animals):
  - Do not turn and run. It may trigger a chase response.
  - Make yourself look big.
  - Make noise, but do not make high-pitched screams.
  - Pick up children and small pets.
  - Back away slowly or move sideways.
  - Use bear or pepper spray if available.
  - Fight back if attacked (except for grizzly/brown bears - see next point). Use knives, sticks, rocks, or your hands. Aim for the eyes, nose, or throat.
  - Play dead if it is a grizzly/brown bear attacking. Lay flat on the ground with your hands clasped behind your neck. The exception to grizzly attacks is if it attacks you in your tent, stalks you before attacking, or continues attacking after playing dead. In this case, fight back.
  - Do not drop your pack, as it can provide protection.

## Bites: Snakes
<!-- K: snake, bite, venom, poison, antivenom, snakebite -->
<!-- S: Treat by cleaning the wound, applying a bandage, immobilizing the limb, and seeking medical attention. Prevent by watching where you step and wearing high boots. -->

Always be on the lookout for snakes, especially in areas with tall grass, rocks, or logs. Snakes are most active during the day. Most snake bites are not venomous, but if you don't know the type of snake, treat the bite as venomous.

### Treatment
1. Rinse the bite area with water.
2. Clean the wound and cover with a bandage.
3. Remove any rings or jewelry from the affected limb.
4. Wrap the limb with a bandage, starting at the bite and moving up the limb. The bandage should be tight but not cut off circulation. You should be able to slip a finger under the bandage.
5. Keep the limb immobilized, as you would a fracture, and below the level of the heart.
6. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. Call the hospital ahead of time so they can prepare antivenom if needed.

Do not do the following:
- Cut the wound.
- Suck out the venom.
- Apply a tourniquet.
- Apply ice.

### Prevention
- Watch where you step.
- Wear high boots.
- Do not put your hands or feet where you cannot see.
- Do not try to catch or kill snakes unless you are sure they are not venomous.

## Bites / stings: bugs
<!-- K: bug, bite, repel, spray, sting, insect, tick, leech, spider, scorpion, mosquito, ant, bee, wasp, hornet, fly, itch, swell, red -->
<!-- S: Treat by removing the stinger/tick/leech, cleaning the area, and if needed seek medical attention. Prevent by using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants. -->

Many insects can bite or sting you, causing pain, swelling, and itching. Some insects can also transmit diseases.

### Symptoms
- Itching.
- Swelling.
- Redness.

### Treatment

**Ticks**

1. Using tweezers if available, grasp the tick where it is attached to the skin.
2. Pull straight out with steady, even pressure. Do not twist or jerk the tick. Do not squeeze the tick's body.
3. Treat the area as you would for a bug bite.

**Leeches**

To remove a leech:
1. Pull it taut (but not too tight).
2. Slide a fingernail or other flat object between the leech and your skin to detach it.
3. Flick the leech away before it can reattach.
4. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.
5. Apply a bandage to control bleeding. It is normal for the wound to bleed for a while.

Do not salt, burn, or pull the leech off, as this can cause the leech to regurgitate into the wound.

**Bites**

Avoid scratching and apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to reduce itching. You can use a cloth soaked in cold water or filled with snow/ice to reduce swelling.

If you were bit by a spider that you believe to be venomous, treat as you would a snake bite and seek medical attention.

**Stings**

Remove any stingers, taking care not to squeeze the venom sac. Treat as you would a bug bite.

If you were stung by a scorpion or insect that you believe to be venomous, treat as you would a snake bite and seek medical attention.

**Bugs in eyes**

See the section on objects in the eye.

### Prevention
- Use insect repellent.
- Wear long sleeves and pants.
- Wrap your face with a bandana.
- Wear glasses / sunglasses (keeps bugs out of your eyes).
- Use a bug net.
- Check for ticks / leeches frequently.
- Ensure your immunizations are up to date for bug-borne diseases in the area.

You can make an improvised bug repellent by applying mud to your skin or using the smoke from a fire.

## Bleeding
<!-- K: bleed, blood, wound, cut, scrape, deep, clot, pressure, tourniquet, bandage, red, swell, warm, pus -->
<!-- S: Treat by applying pressure, cleaning the wound, bandaging, and if needed seek medical attention. Prevent infection by cleaning wounds and changing bandages frequently. -->

### Treatment
Seek medical attention if the wound is deep, bleeding profusely, or shows signs of infection. Infected wounds can be identified by redness, swelling, warmth, and pus.

**Scrapes and small cuts**
1. Clean the wound with water.
2. Optionally, apply antibiotic ointment.
3. Apply a bandage.

**Deeper cuts**
1. Apply pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage. You may need to apply pressure for a while, about 10 to 20 minutes.
2. Clean the wound and irrigate it with water.
3. Bandage the wound with a sterile dressing.
4. Place new bandages over the old ones if they become soaked with blood.
5. Raise the wound above the level of the heart.
6. Seek medical attention if bleeding does not stop or if the wound is deep.

If direct pressure does not work on a limb, you can apply a tourniquet to stop blood flow. This should only be done as a last resort, as it can cause permanent damage to the limb. Only a medical professional should remove a tourniquet.

## Embedded fishhooks
<!-- K: fishhook, hook, remove -->
<!-- S: Hooks can be removed by running a line through the bend and pulling quickly while pushing down on the hook. Prevent by handling hooks with care. -->

Fishhooks are designed to penetrate flesh and are difficult to remove without causing further injury. Unless you need to remove the hook to prevent further injury, it is best to leave the hook in place and seek medical attention.

### Treatment
Do not attempt to remove a fishhook if it is embedded in the eye.

**Method 1**

1. Advance the hook through the skin until the barb is exposed.
2. Cut the barb off with wire cutters, such as those on a multitool or pliers.
3. Pull the hook out in the opposite direction it entered, it should come out easily.
4. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

**Method 2**

1. Run a piece of fishing line or cordage through the bend of the hook.
2. Grab the ends of the string.
3. Apply downward pressure on the eye of the hook.
4. Quickly pull the string, causing the hook to come out the way it went in.
5. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/hook_removal.webp)

### Prevention

### Treatment
If the bone is out of place and medical attention is unavailable for several hours, you may need to set the bone. Otherwise, splint the bone in place and seek medical attention.

**Setting a bone**

1. Irrigate and clean the wound if the bone is protruding.
2. Grab the limb below the fracture.
3. Pull the limb to straighten the bone. It may pop into place and pain may decrease.
4. Splint the bone while holding the bone in place.
5. Cover the open wound with a sterile dressing and bandage.

**Splinting a bone**

1. Remove all jewelry and tight clothing from the area.
2. Apply padding around the fracture.
3. Construct a splint using a rigid object (such as a stick, trekking pole, or tent pole). It should extend past the bone break on both sides.
4. Secure the splint in place with bandages, tape, or cordage. The splint should be tight but not cut off circulation. If splinting a finger, tape it to the finger next to it.
5. Apply a sling if the fracture is in the arm to help immobilize the limb.
