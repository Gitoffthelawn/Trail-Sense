## Bug bites and stings
Many insects can bite or sting you, causing pain, swelling, and itching. Some insects can also transmit diseases.

### Symptoms
- Itching.
- Swelling.
- Redness.

### Treatment

**Ticks**

Using tweezers if available, grasp the tick where it is attached to the skin and pull straight out with steady, even pressure. Do not twist or jerk the tick. Do not squeeze the tick's body. Treat as you would a bug bite.

***Leaches***

***Bites***

Avoid scratching and apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to reduce itching. You can use a cloth soaked in cold water or filled with snow/ice to reduce swelling.

***Stings***

Remove any stingers, taking care not to squeeze the venom sac. Treat as you would a bug bite.

**Bugs in eyes**

See the section on objects in the eye.

### Prevention
- Use insect repellent.
- Wear long sleeves and pants.
- Wrap your face with a bandana.
- Wear glasses / sunglasses (keeps bugs out of your eyes).

- Check for ticks / leeches frequently.
- Ensure your immunizations are up to date for bug-borne diseases in the area.

## Snake bites
Always be on the lookout for snakes, especially in areas with tall grass, rocks, or logs. Snakes are most active during the day. Most snake bites are not venomous, but if you don't know what kind of snake bit you, treat it as if it is venomous.

### Treatment
1. Rinse the bite area with water.
2. Clean the wound and cover with a bandage.
3. Remove any rings or jewelry from the affected limb.
4. Wrap the limb with a bandage, starting at the bite and moving up the limb. The bandage should be tight but not cut off circulation. You should be able to slip a finger under the bandage.
5. Keep the limb immobilized, as you would a fracture, and below the level of the heart.
6. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. Call the hospital ahead of time so they can prepare antivenom if needed.

Do not do the following:
- Cut the wound.
- Suck out the venom.
- Apply a tourniquet.
- Apply ice.

### Prevention
- Watch where you step.
- Wear high boots.
- Do not put your hands or feet where you cannot see.
- Do not try to catch or kill snakes unless you are sure they are not venomous.

## Animal bites and attacks
Many animals bite when they feel threatened or cornered. Some animals can transmit diseases through their bites.

### Treatment
1. Wash the wound with soap and water.
2. Apply antibiotic ointment.
3. Cover the wound with a bandage. Pack the wound with gauze if it is deep, but do not suture or tape it closed.
4. Seek medical attention if the wound is deep, bleeding, or shows signs of infection.

If you were bit by a mammal, seek medical attention as soon as possible. You may need rabies shots.

### Prevention
- Do not approach or corner wild animals.
- Do not feed wild animals.
- Use a bear bell or make noise to alert animals of your presence.
- Stay clear of any animal with young nearby.
- If an animal is approaching you (most animals):
  - Do not turn and run. It may trigger a chase response.
  - Make yourself look big.
  - Make noise, but do not make high-pitched screams.
  - Pick up children and small pets.
  - Back away slowly or move sideways.
  - Use bear or pepper spray if available.
  - Fight back if attacked (except for grizzly/brown bears - see next point). Use knives, sticks, rocks, or your hands. Aim for the eyes, nose, or throat.
  - Play dead if it is a grizzly/brown bear attacking. Lay flat on the ground with your hands clasped behind your neck. The exception to grizzly attacks is if it attacks you in your tent, stalks you before attacking, or continues attacking after playing dead. In this case, fight back.
  - Do not drop your pack, as it can provide protection.

## Poison ivy and contact dermatitis
Contact dermatitis is caused by contact with poisonous plants, such as poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.

TODO: Stinging nettle

### Symptoms
- Burning, reddening, and swelling rash
- Itching
- Blisters

### Treatment
1. Try to remove oil from the plant using soap and water. Sand or dirt can be used as a substitute, unless there are blisters.
2. Dry the area.
3. Apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to reduce the itch. If not available, apply a tannic acid solution (boil acorns or oak bark in water) or crushed jewelweed.
4. Optionally, take antihistamine pills to reduce itching.

Avoid scratching the rash, as it can cause infection. Leave blisters alone.

### Prevention
Learn to identify and avoid contact with the following plants:
- Cowhage.
- Poison ivy.
- Poison oak.
- Poison sumac.
- Rengas tree.
- Trumpet vine.

If you come into contact with these plants, wash the area with soap and water as soon as possible. Do not wait for a rash to appear.

Do not burn these plants, as the smoke can cause irritation.

4. Elevate the area.

### Prevention
- Warm up before physical activity.
- Wear proper footwear.
- Do not overexert yourself.
- Watch your step.

## Embedded fishhooks
Fishhooks are designed to penetrate flesh and are difficult to remove without causing further injury. Unless you need to remove the hook to prevent further injury, it is best to leave the hook in place and seek medical attention.

### Treatment
Do not attempt to remove a fishhook if it is embedded in the eye.

**Method 1**

1. Advance the hook through the skin until the barb is exposed.
2. Cut the barb off with wire cutters, such as those on a multitool or pliers.
3. Pull the hook out in the opposite direction it entered, it should come out easily.
4. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

**Method 2**

1. Run a piece of fishing line or cordage through the bend of the hook.
2. Grab the ends of the string.
3. Apply downward pressure on the eye of the hook.
4. Quickly pull the string, causing the hook to come out the way it went in.
5. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/hook_removal.webp)

### Prevention
- Be careful when handling fishhooks.
- Use a barbless hook if possible (these don't work as well when fishing).

## Objects in the eye
While in the wilderness it is common to get objects in your eye, such as dirt, sand, bugs, or an eyelash.

### Symptoms
- Pain and discomfort of the eye.
- Redness of the eye.
- Excess tearing.
- Difficulty keeping the eye open.

### Treatment
1. Avoid rubbing the eye.
2. Using clean water, irrigate the eye by pouring water into the eye.
3. If the object is still in the eye, use a mirror to find the object and attempt to remove it using a damp cloth or cotton swab. Be very gentle.
4. If the object is under the upper eyelid, and you have a partner: place the tip of a cotton swab in the middle of the upper eyelid and fold the eyelid over the cotton swab. You can then remove the object using a damp cloth or cotton swab.
5. After the object is removed, if the eye feels scratchy, place a cold damp cloth over the eye, keep the eye closed and rest, use eye drops, or construct an eye patch using a bandage or cloth.
6. Seek medical attention if the object is not removed or if symptoms persist.

### Prevention
- Wear glasses or sunglasses.
- Don't lift objects with dirt on them above your head without eye protection.

## Snow blindness
Snow blindness is caused when there is too much sunlight reflecting off snow, ice, or water into your eyes.

### Symptoms
- Eyes are red, scratchy, and watery.
- Sensitivity to light.
- Headache.

### Treatment
Cover eyes with a dark cloth until symptoms disappear.

### Prevention
Wear UV protective sunglasses or snow goggles. If you do not have these, you can make snow goggles from a piece of cloth or a piece of bark with slits cut in it. You can also put soot under your eyes to reduce glare.

## Sunburn
Sunburn is caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.

### Symptoms
- Redness.
- Pain.
- Swelling.
- Blisters.

### Treatment
1. Get out of the sun.
