A well-constructed shelter can protect you from environmental hazards such as sun, wind, rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. It also boosts morale. This guide focuses on clothing as your primary shelter and details constructing both man-made and natural shelters.

## Clothing

Your first line of defense in any environment—whether hot, cold, tropical, desert, or arctic—is your clothing. Proper attire should keep you dry, regulate your body temperature, protect you from the sun, and prevent insect bites.

### Clothing considerations

- **Footwear**: Ensure boots are well-broken in to avoid blisters. Choose socks made from materials suited to your environment: wool for insulation, cotton for coolness, and polypropylene for moisture-wicking.
- **Layering**: Wear clothing in loose layers to adjust easily for temperature changes and to trap insulating air.
- **Maintenance**: Keep clothing clean and dry. Use the "COLDER" principle for care:
  - **Clean**: Dirty clothing loses insulation.
  - **Overheating**: Avoid excessive sweating.
  - **Loose and layers**: Opt for loose clothing in layers.
  - **Dry**: Keep garments dry to maintain warmth.
  - **Examine**: Regularly check for wear and tear.
  - **Repair**: Mend tears and holes promptly.

If you need extra insulation in a pinch, stuff your clothing with dry leaves, grass, or other insulating materials.

## Building shelters

### Choosing a shelter location

When selecting a site for your shelter, consider the following:
- Proximity to building materials.
- Proximity to water and food sources.
- Protection from the elements.
- Free of dead trees and branches that could fall.
- Free of threat from avalanches, rockslides, or flooding.
- Free of insects, poisonous plants, or dangerous animals.
- Suitable for signaling for help if needed.

### Shelter types

You can construct various shelters using materials like tarps, ponchos, or natural elements. Here are some common types:

**Lean-to**

A simple shelter made by leaning a large sheet of material against a support like a tree or a ridgepole. It provides protection from wind and rain. 

1. Lash a ridgepole to two trees or supports. This can be a cord if you are using a tarp or poncho.
2. Lay a tarp or poncho over the ridgepole, allowing one side to touch the ground. If using natural materials, lay branches and leaves over the ridgepole.
3. Secure the sides with stakes or rocks.

**A-frame**

A more enclosed shelter that provides better protection from the elements.

1. Lash two sticks together into an A shape.
2. Place the ridgepole across the top of the A.
3. Lay a tarp or poncho over the ridgepole, securing the sides with stakes or rocks. If using natural materials, lay branches and leaves over the ridgepole.

**Caves**

Natural shelters that offer protection from the elements. Use caution when entering caves, as they can be home to animals or have poor ventilation. Avoid lighting a fire if possible since smoke can accumulate.

### Shelter construction tips

- **Insulation**: Use materials like leaves, straw, or clothing to insulate the ground and walls of your shelter.
- **Size**: Keep the shelter compact to retain heat but large enough to lie down comfortably.
- **Orientation**: Position the shelter to protect against prevailing winds and to maximize warming effects of the sun.

### Maintaining your shelter

- **Ventilation**: Ensure adequate airflow to manage condensation and smoke.
- **Check and repair**: Regularly inspect and repair any damage to maintain the shelter's integrity and effectiveness.
