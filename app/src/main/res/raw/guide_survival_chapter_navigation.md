## Deciding whether to move or stay put

When deciding whether to stay put or move, consider the following factors:

- **Safety and security**: Assess any threats, including natural or human factors that might compromise your safety.
- **Resource availability**: Ensure the location has or is near essential resources like water and shelter.
- **Health and capability**: Evaluate physical and mental health; avoid travel if you're injured or not mentally prepared.
- **Environmental conditions**: Consider environmental factors that could impact movement, such as extreme weather or difficult terrain.
- **Recovery likelihood**: Stay put if recovery is likely soon; move if it improves your chances of rescue or meeting basic needs.

## Movement

Proper movement techniques can help conserve energy and maintain speed:

- **Posture and balance**: Keep your body weight balanced over your feet. Use a flat-footed stance to maintain stability.
- **Terrain navigation**: Adjust your movement to the terrain. Use zigzag paths on steep slopes and maintain a bend in your knees when descending to protect your joints.
- **Environmental awareness**: Be aware of natural paths like animal trails, which may offer easier travel and potential resources like water.
- **Planning**: Study the terrain and plan your route in advance. Set up camp early to ensure enough time for shelter construction.

### Environments

**Mountainous/cold**:

When moving in mountainous or cold environments, consider the following:

- **Avalanche risk**: Avoid areas prone to avalanches and be cautious when crossing snow-covered slopes.
- **Altitude sickness**: Acclimate to high altitudes to avoid symptoms like headaches, nausea, and fatigue.
- **Wind chill**: Protect against wind chill by wearing appropriate clothing and taking shelter when necessary.
- **Snow travel**: Use snowshoes or skis for easier travel in snowy conditions. Test ice and snow conditions with a pole or stick before stepping.
- **Frozen water**: Avoid walking on frozen bodies of water unless you're certain of the ice thickness.

**Desert**:

When navigating desert environments, keep in mind:

- **Hydration**: Conserve water by traveling during cooler hours and wearing appropriate clothing to reduce sweating.
- **Salt marshes**: Avoid salt marshes, as they can be dangerous and difficult to navigate.
- **Temperature shifts**: Prepare for the drastic temperature shifts between day and night. Wear appropriate clothing to protect against sun exposure and cold nights.
- **Electronics**: Protect electronic devices from extreme heat and direct sunlight.
- **Shadows**: Stick to the shadows to avoid direct sun exposure and reduce the risk of heat exhaustion.
- **Distance perception**: Distance can be deceiving in the desert (paths often look shorter than they are); plan your route carefully and carry enough water and supplies.

**Jungle**:

When navigating jungle environments, remember:

- **Recovery**: It will be harder to find you under a dense canopy.
- **Vegetation**: Move with the vegetation rather than fighting against it to conserve energy.
- **Navigation**: Focus on distant landmarks rather than near objects to maintain direction.
- **Insects**: Wear protective clothing to avoid insect bites and stings.
- **Wounds**: Treat any wounds and scratches promptly to avoid infection.

### Crossing water

- **Assessment**: Look for the narrowest part of the river or a place where it breaks into several channels.
- **Precautions**: Avoid crossing areas with strong currents or near ledges that indicate rapids.

## GPS

A GPS device can help you determine your location and navigate to a specific point, but always have a backup plan in case the device fails.

### Location

A GPS uses satellites to determine your current location. Make sure the device has a clear view of the sky to receive signals. Most GPS units display your coordinates in latitude and longitude, which can be plotted onto a map.

### Waypoints

A waypoint is a specific location you want to navigate to. You can enter waypoints into your GPS to guide you to your destination. Most devices allow you to enter waypoints before your trip, but you can also add them as you go. Place waypoints frequently so you can backtrack if necessary.

If using Trail Sense, you can utilize the Navigation, Beacons, Paths, and Photo Maps tools to assist with navigation.

### Battery

Your GPS device may run out of battery, so carry extra batteries or a portable charger to keep it powered.

### Digital maps

If your GPS supports digital maps, download maps of your area in advance to navigate even if you lose the signal.

## Compass

A compass helps you determine direction and is essential for navigation, especially when used with a map.

### Bearings

A bearing is the direction you need to travel to reach a specific point. You can determine a bearing by aligning the compass needle with the desired direction on the compass housing. Once you have the bearing, follow it to your destination. Pick a prominent feature in the distance to navigate toward, avoiding the need for constant compass checks.

### Back bearings

A back bearing is the opposite direction of your current bearing. To calculate a back bearing, if your bearing is less than 180 degrees, add 180. If it's more than 180, subtract 180.

### Declination

Declination is the difference between true north and magnetic north. Adjust your compass for declination when navigating with a map. Some compasses have an adjustable declination ring; otherwise, you’ll need to calculate it manually. Most maps list declination in the legend and are oriented to true north.

## Map

A map is a key tool for navigation, especially when paired with a compass.

### Orientation

You can orient a map to point north using a compass:
1. Place the compass on the map with the direction of travel arrow pointing toward the top of the map.
2. Rotate the map and compass together until the compass points north.

### Determining location

To determine your location on a map, identify prominent features around you and match them to the map. Use a compass to determine which direction you're facing and align the map accordingly.

To triangulate your location:
1. Orient the map to point north using your compass.
2. Identify two prominent features around you and mark them on the map.
3. Measure the bearing to each feature using your compass.
4. Draw lines from each feature in the direction of the bearing on the map.
5. The point where the lines intersect is your location.

### Scale

Maps are drawn to scale, allowing you to determine distances between points. A bar on the map indicates the scale. Using a ruler, string, or even your finger, you can measure distances.

### Topographic maps

Topographic maps show elevation changes and terrain features, making them useful for navigating in mountainous or hilly areas. Contour lines indicate elevation, and the closer the lines are together, the steeper the terrain. Elevation markers on contour lines help identify peaks and valleys.

## Advanced navigation techniques

### Sun

- **Shadow tip method**: Place a stick vertically in the ground and mark the shadow tip. After 10-15 minutes, mark the new position of the shadow tip and draw a line between the two points for an east-west line. North will be perpendicular to this line at midday.

- **Watch method**: Point the hour hand of an analog watch at the sun; south is roughly halfway between the hour hand and 12 o’clock in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, point the 12 o’clock position at the sun. If on daylight saving time, use 1 o’clock instead of 12.

- **Time until sunset**: You can estimate the time until sunset by holding your hand horizontally with fingers together and counting the number of finger widths between the sun and the horizon. Each finger width is roughly 15 minutes.

### Stars

- **Northern Hemisphere**: Identify Polaris (the North Star) using the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia as reference points. Polaris is located at the end of the Little Dipper’s handle.

- **Southern Hemisphere**: Use the Southern Cross to determine south. Extend a line from the top and bottom stars of the Cross’s long axis, continuing about 4.5 times the distance between these stars toward the horizon to approximate the South Pole.

### Environmental cues

- **Vegetation**: Moss often grows more thickly on the shaded and moist side of trees, generally the north side in the Northern Hemisphere and the south side in the Southern Hemisphere.
- **Snow**: On slopes, snow melts faster on the side receiving more sunlight (south-facing in the Northern Hemisphere, north-facing in the Southern Hemisphere).
