Toxicodendron Radicans
Toxicodendron radicans, commonly known as eastern poison ivy or poison ivy, is a species of allergenic flowering plant. It has numerous subtaxons and forms both vines and shrubs. Despite its common name, it is not a true ivy, but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family Anacardiaceae. It is different from western poison ivy, Toxicodendron rydbergii, and resembles a number of species.
