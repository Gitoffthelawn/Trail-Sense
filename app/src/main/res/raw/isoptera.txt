Termite
Termites are a group of detritophagous eusocial insects which consume a variety of decaying plant material, generally in the form of wood, leaf litter, and soil humus. They are distinguished by their moniliform antennae and the soft-bodied and often unpigmented worker caste for which they have been commonly termed "white ants"; however, they are not ants, being more closely related to cockroaches. About 2,972 extant species are currently described, 2,105 of which are members of the family Termitidae.
