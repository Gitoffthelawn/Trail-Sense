## What to do in a survival situation
If you are in a survival situation, do not panic. Follow these steps.

### Stop
If you are lost and not in danger, stay where you are. Moving around can make it harder for people to find you.

If you are scared, take deep breaths to calm down. If this does not help, check the Medical chapter for advice.

If you have a GPS device or smartphone, save your location. This helps you find your way back if needed.

### Think
Ask yourself:
- What do I need now?
- What things do I have with me?
- Did I tell someone my plans? When are they expecting me back?
- Which way did I come from?

### Observe
Check your surroundings:
- Look for dangers and useful things.
- Check your GPS or smartphone for your last location.
- Check your phone for a signal.
- Listen for people or vehicles.

### Plan
Decide what to do next. Here are general tips:
- If it is getting dark, make a shelter and maybe a fire.
- If you are hurt, treat your wounds.
- If you are lost, try to find your location using a map or GPS.
- If it is hot, find shade and water.
- If it is cold, stay warm with clothes, shelter, and fire.
- Tie a bright piece of clothing to a tree and look for a trail. Keep the marker in sight. You can also use a GPS device to go back to where you started, but make sure it has enough battery power.
- If lost, it may be best to stay in one place, wait, and signal for help.

### Act
Follow your plan. If you feel unsafe, scared, or unsure, stop and think again.

## Planning a trip
Good planning makes your hike safe and fun. Follow these steps:

1. Learn about the area, weather, animals, and plants. Also, check the local rules and needed permission.
2. Plan your route using a map. Think about trail conditions and backup routes.
3. Pack the right gear. See "Be ready" for a list of items. Check all gear before leaving.
4. Look at the weather forecast and change plans if needed.
5. Tell a trusted person your plans, route, return time, and check-in times.

## Signaling for help

### Mobile phone
Even if you do not have a signal, you may still be able to call emergency services. If calling does not work, try sending a text. Check for a signal now and then, but keep your phone off or in airplane mode to save battery. A better signal may be found on higher ground or in open areas.

### Whistle
Three short blows mean "help." Cover your ears when blowing loudly.

### Signal mirror
Hold the mirror in one hand. Use your other hand to make a "V" with your fingers. Shine the sunlight onto your fingers, then move the mirror to point the light at people or aircraft.

### Smoke
Smoke can be seen from far away. Burn green plants to make a lot of smoke, but do it safely.

### Flares
Flares work best at night or in bad weather. Read the instructions on the package and check if using them is allowed in your area.

### Flashlight
At night, use a flashlight to signal for help. The SOS signal is three short flashes, three long flashes, and three short flashes. If you forget SOS, flash the light in groups of three. Point it toward planes or people.

### Ground signals
Use big objects like rocks or logs to make large symbols on the ground. A "V" means you need help. An "X" means you need medical help. Use bright or different-colored materials to make them easy to see.
