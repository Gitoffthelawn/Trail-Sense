### Knowledge and skills

Start by learning how to do the following:
- Choose clothing appropriate for your environment.
- Use an emergency space blanket.
- Get warm quickly.
- Layer clothing for warmth.
- Set up a tent and sleeping bag.
- Identify environmental hazards when selecting a shelter location.
- Tie several types of knots.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Construct a natural shelter.
- Repair clothing.

## Clothing
<!-- K: wear, dress, wool, polyester, nylon, down, cotton, layer, material, garment, socks, pants, shirt, jacket, fleece, vest, underwear, undergarments, windbreaker, rain, hat, sunglasses, glasses, scarf, bandana, footwear, shoes, boots -->
<!-- S: Dress in layers and choose clothing made from wool, polyester, or nylon. Only wear shoes that you have worn in. -->

Your first line of defense in any environment is your clothing. Proper attire should keep you dry, regulate your body temperature, protect you from the sun, and prevent insect bites.

### Materials
When choosing clothing, consider the following materials:
- Wool: Retains warmth even when wet.
- Polyester/nylon: Quick-drying and moisture-wicking.
- Down: Lightweight and insulating but loses warmth when wet.
- Cotton: Retains moisture and loses warmth when wet. Do not wear cotton in cold or wet environments.

### Layers
You should plan to wear multiple layers of clothing to protect against the elements. Layering allows you to adjust your clothing to changing conditions and maintain body temperature.

In cold environments, remove or add layers as needed to prevent sweating while staying warm.

In warm environments, you may only need to wear a base layer. But you should always pack rain gear, such as an emergency poncho, in case of sudden weather changes.

If you need extra insulation in a pinch, stuff your clothing with dry leaves, grass, or other insulating materials.

- **Base layer**: Wicks moisture away from the skin. This layer should be tight-fitting.
  - Undergarments
  - Socks
  - Pants
  - Shirt
- **Middle layer**: Insulates and retains heat. This layer should be loose-fitting.
  - Sweater
  - Fleece jacket
  - Insulated pants
  - Vest
- **Outer layer**: Protects against wind, rain, and snow. This layer should be loose-fitting.
  - Rain gear
  - Windbreaker
- **Accessories**: Protect against sun, wind, cold, and insects.
  - Hat
  - Sunglasses
  - Gloves
  - Scarf or bandana

### Footwear
Be sure to choose footwear that is appropriate for your environment. In cold climates, wear insulated, waterproof boots. In hot climates, wear breathable, lightweight shoes. Always break in new footwear before a trip to avoid blisters.

If you plan to be hiking in wet conditions, consider wearing waterproof boots.

Bring extra pairs of socks, preferably made from wool, and ensure they are taller than your boots to avoid blisters.

## Shelters
<!-- K: build, location, lean-to, a-frame, cave, emergency-space-blanket, space-blanket, blanket, tent, hammock, ground, wall, sleep, bag, pad, airflow -->
<!-- S: Construct a shelter using natural materials or a tarp. Insulate the shelter with leaves, straw, or clothing. -->

### Choosing a shelter location

When selecting a site for your shelter, consider the following:
- Proximity to building materials.
- Proximity to water and food sources.
- Protection from the elements.
- Free of dead trees and branches that could fall.
- Free of threat from avalanches, rockslides, or flooding.
- Free of insects, poisonous plants, or dangerous animals.
- Suitable for signaling for help if needed.

### Gathering materials
Prefer wood and debris that are already on the ground and require minimal effort to use. Avoid logs that are too thick to break by hand.

### Shelter types

You can construct various shelters using materials like tarps, ponchos, or natural elements. Here are some common types:

**Lean-to**

A simple shelter made by leaning a large sheet of material against a support like a tree or a ridgepole. It provides protection from wind and rain.

1. Lash a ridgepole to two trees or supports. This can be a cord if you are using a tarp or poncho.
2. Lay a tarp or poncho over the ridgepole, allowing one side to touch the ground. If using natural materials, lay branches and leaves over the ridgepole.
3. Secure the sides with stakes or rocks.

**A-frame**

A more enclosed shelter that provides better protection from the elements.

1. Lash two sticks together into an A shape.
2. Place the ridgepole across the top of the A.
3. Lay a tarp or poncho over the ridgepole, securing the sides with stakes or rocks. If using natural materials, lay branches and leaves over the ridgepole.

**Caves**

Natural shelters that offer protection from the elements. Use caution when entering caves, as they can be home to animals or have poor ventilation. Avoid lighting a fire if possible since smoke can accumulate.

**Emergency space blankets**

Wrap yourself in an emergency space blanket to reflect body heat and protect against the elements. You can also use it to create a shelter by tying it between two trees or supports.

**Tents**

If you have a tent, set it up according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure the tent is staked securely and the rainfly is in place. Most tents can be set up by inserting poles into sleeves or clips and securing the tent to the ground with stakes.

**Hammocks**

If you have a hammock, set it up between two trees or supports. Ensure the hammock is secure and the rainfly is in place. Be sure the trees or supports are strong enough to hold your weight.

### Insulation

To retain body heat, you can place insulating materials like leaves, straw, or clothing between you and the shelter walls. This barrier prevents heat loss and keeps you warm. If you have a sleeping bag or extra clothing, use them.

To insulate yourself from the ground, use materials like leaves, straw, or clothing. These materials create a barrier between you and the cold ground, preventing heat loss. If you have a sleeping pad, place it under your sleeping bag for additional insulation.

### Tips

- Use materials like leaves, straw, or clothing to insulate the ground and walls of your shelter.
- Keep the shelter compact to retain heat but large enough to lie down comfortably.
- Position the shelter to protect against prevailing winds and to maximize warming effects of the sun.
- Fill gaps in the shelter with leaves, grass, mud, or other insulating materials.
- Ensure adequate airflow to manage condensation and smoke.

## Repair

### Other methods
If you do not have a sewing kit, you can use duct tape, safety pins, super glue, cordage, or pitch (see the Crafting chapter for how to make pitch) as temporary fixes.

## Knots
<!-- K: knot, tie, cordage, cord, rope, paracord, overhand, square, bowline, figure-eight, 8, sheet-bend, bight, hitch, lash, sheepshank, prussic, whip -->
<!-- S: The following knots are easy to learn and can be used in most situations: overhand, square, two half-hitches, bowline, and shear lashing. -->

### Overhand knot
Used to prevent the end of a rope from untwisting.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/120.webp)

### Round turn and two half hitches
Used to anchor rope to a pole or tree.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/121.webp)

### Figure-eight knot
Used to form a larger knot than would be formed by an overhand knot at the end of a rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/122.webp)

### Square knot
Used for tying two ropes of equal diameter together. Be sure to tie a true square knot to prevent slipping, if you reverse the procedure, the knot will slip under strain.

Untie by grasping the bends of the two bights and pulling the knot apart.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/123.webp)

### Single sheet bend
Used for tying two ropes of unequal diameter together. This knot will draw tight under light loads but may loosen or slip when the tension is released.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/124.webp)

### Double sheet bend
Used for tying two ropes of unequal diameter together. This knot will not slip or draw tight under heavy loads.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/125.webp)

### Bowline
Useful for forming a loop in the end of a rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/126.webp)

### Bowline on a bight
Useful for forming a loop at some point in a rope other than at the end.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/127.webp)

### French bowline
Used as a sling for lifting people. If used in this manner, one loop is used around the body under the arms.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/128.webp)

### Two half hitches
Used to tie a rope to a timber or pole. The single half hitch is not very secure without load, so use an overhand or the two half hitches instead.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/130.webp)

### Timber hitch
Used for moving heavy timbers or poles. You can make a tighter hold on heavy poles for lifting or dragging by combining a timber hitch and half hitch.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/131.webp)

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/132.webp)

### Clove hitch
Used to fasten a rope to a timber, pipe, or post. It can be tied at any point in a rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/133.webp)

### Sheepshank
Used to shorten a rope or take the load off a weak spot in the rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/134.webp)

### Prussic
Used to tie a short rope around a longer rope in such a manner that the short rope will slide on the other rope if no tension is applied, and will hold if tension is applied on the short rope.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/135.webp)

### Trucker's hitch
Used to secure a load or tighten a line.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/truckers_hitch.webp)

### Square lashing
Used to secure one pole at a right angle to another pole. Can swap with the diagonal lashing if desired.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/136.webp)

### Diagonal lashing
Used to secure one pole at a right angle to another pole. Can swap with the square lashing if desired.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/137.webp)

### Shear lashing
Used for lashing two or more poles in a series.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/138.webp)

### Whipping
Used to prevent the end of a rope from fraying or for making a more comfortable handle on a tool.

## Craft: Pitch (glue)
<!-- K: pitch, glue, resin, pine, repair, craft -->
<!-- S: You can make pitch from tree resin, charcoal, and organic material. -->

Pitch is a natural glue made from tree resin. It can be used to repair tools, make waterproof containers, and as a fire starter.

**Resources**
- 2 parts tree resin (pine, spruce, or fir), preferably hardened chunks
- 1 part ground charcoal
- 1 part ground organic material (dried bark/leaves, sawdust, deer/moose droppings, animal fat, or wax)
- Container or a rock with a depression
- Stick or bone for stirring

**Instructions**
1. Melt the resin in a container over a fire. Be careful not to burn it.
2. Remove from heat.
3. Stir in the charcoal and organic material.
4. You can either let it cool in the container or continue to step 5.
5. Dip the end of a stick into the pitch to coat it.
6. Remove the stick and let the pitch cool, ensuring it forms an even coat.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have a thick layer of pitch on the stick, it should look like a large matchstick.

**Usage**
1. Melt the pitch in a container over a fire.
2. Apply the pitch to the object you want to repair, as you would with glue.
3. Let the pitch cool and harden.

## Craft: Cordage
<!-- K: cordage, rope, twine, fiber, twist, cord, strand, paracord, craft -->
<!-- S: You can make cordage from grasses and sedges. -->

### Twine
Twine is made by twisting fibers together. It is weaker than rope but can be used for sewing, fishing line, or light-duty cordage.

**Resources**

Any fibrous material can be used to make cordage. Some examples include:
- Grasses and sedges (sedges are stronger)
- Bark or palm fiber

**Instructions**
1. Gather the fibers into a loose bundle.
2. Hold the bundle near the center and twist one side clockwise until a kink forms.
3. Fold the bundle in half at the kink.
4. Twist the top half clockwise.
5. Twist the two halves together counterclockwise.
6. Repeat the process until you have a full strand. If a material is running out, add more material to it and twist it in.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/139.webp)

### Rope
Rope is made by braiding multiple strands of twine together. It is stronger than twine and can be used for heavier tasks.

**Resources**
- 3 or more strands of twine
- A small strand, tape, or pitch

**Instructions**
1. Lay the strands parallel to each other.
2. Cross the right strand over the center strand and under the left strand.
3. Repeat the process with the new rightmost strand.
4. Once you reach the ends, you can whip the ends or coat them with pitch to prevent unraveling. See the knots section for more information on whipping.
5. You can repeat this process using ropes instead of twine to make even stronger rope.
