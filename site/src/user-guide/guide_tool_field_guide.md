The Field Guide tool can be used to identify plants, animals, and other objects in the wild.

## Pages
Pages are organized into categories, such as plants and animals. You can click on a category to view the pages. The name, image, and the first sentence of the page's notes are displayed for each item. Click on an item to view the full page. On pages that you created, you will see a menu button that allows you to edit or delete the page.

You can search for pages by name, notes, or tags. The search results will be displayed as you type.

## Built-in pages
Trail Sense includes a set of built-in pages that cover common plants, animals, mushrooms, and rocks that are beneficial for wilderness survival. You can not edit or delete these pages.

## Create a page
To create a new page, click the add button in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can add a name, image, notes, and tags to the page. The image can be taken with the camera or selected from the gallery. You can click the check button in the top right corner to save the page.

If you had a category selected when you created the page, the new page will be pre-filled with that category. Pages without a category will be displayed in the "Other" category.

## Edit a page
To edit a page, click the menu button on a page row and select "Edit". You can change the name, image, notes, and tags of the page. You can click the check button in the top right corner to save the changes.

## Delete a page
To delete a page, click the menu button on a page row and select "Delete". You will be asked to confirm the deletion. Deleting a page is permanent and cannot be undone.

This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Always use caution when identifying plants, animals, or mushrooms. Some species may be dangerous or protected. If you are unsure about an identification, consult a professional.
