          <p>
            A practical survival guide for hikers, backpackers, and campers.
            This guide covers the essentials of what to do in a survival
            situation, signaling for help, building a shelter, insulating
            clothing, finding food and water, starting a fire, and predicting
            the weather. This guide purposely excludes advanced bushcraft and
            long term survival skills in an effort to be as practical to the
            average person as possible.
