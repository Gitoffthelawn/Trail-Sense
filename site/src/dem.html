  <p>
    A digital elevation model (DEM) is an elevation map which can be used in place of GPS or barometric altitude
    readings for a more stable reading. The Trail Sense models are generated using ETOPO data. The larger the model, the
    more accurate it will be.
    The largest model has a horizontal resolution of 15 arc seconds, which is 1 / 240 degrees or around 400 meters.
  </p>
  <p>The accuracy listed is for 50% - 90% of the random sampled locations used in my testing. Your results may vary.</p>
