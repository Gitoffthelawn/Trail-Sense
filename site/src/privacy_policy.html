      <p class="bold">Last Updated July 5, 2023</p>
      <p>
        This is the Privacy Policy of Trail Sense. Trail Sense is an Android
        app which uses your phone's sensors to assist with wilderness treks or
        survival situations. This Privacy Policy describes all the sensitive
        data in which Trail Sense uses (does not collect or share), including,
        but not limited to location and background location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Location information gathered by this application does not leave your
        device (as a matter of fact, this app doesn't use the Internet at
        all). The altitude and pressure history for the last 48 hours is
        stored in local app storage - this is used to determine weather
        forecasts. The last known location is also stored in app preferences
        to allow faster load times and support app functionality when the GPS
        can not be reached. The beacons store their location in a local SQLite
        database. All of this information is cleared when you clear the app
        storage or delete it.
      </p>
      <h3>Data collection / storage</h3>
      <p>
        Trail Sense does not collect or share any user information outside of
        the app itself. All data stored by Trail Sense is done locally on your
        device.
      </p>
      <h3>Data retention</h3>
      <p>
        All data (which is stored on your device) is cleared when you clear
        the cache/storage of the application.
      </p>
      <h3>Location and background location</h3>
      <p>
        Trail Sense uses location data for navigation, barometer calibration,
        and astronomy calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">48 hours of altitude history</span>: When weather monitoring is enabled. This is used for sea
        level calibration of barometer data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Your last location</span>: This is used as a cache
        for your location when you either don't have a GPS signal or when the
        GPS fix is taking too long.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Beacon / path information</span>: The coordinates and
        other information for the beacons / paths you create are stored on your
        device, so you can navigate to them in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Sunset alerts</span>: When sunset alerts are enabled, Trail Sense uses your last known
        location in the background to ensure the sunset alert time is accurate while you are traveling.
      </p>
      <h3>Permissions</h3>
      <h4>Sensitive permissions (can be denied)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Notifications</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to display notifications (backtrack, weather, sunset
          alerts, astronomy events, water boil timer, etc)
          <br>
          <small>
            <strong>When denied</strong>: Alerts will not be displayed and some services may not function properly
            depending on your device manufacturer.
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to retrieve your location for navigation, weather (sea level
          calibration), and astronomy.
          <br>
          <small>
            <strong>When denied</strong>: You will have the ability to mock your location under Settings > Sensors >
            GPS. On Android 14+, backtrack and weather will be unavailable due to Android OS constraints.
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Background location</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to retrieve your location for sunset alerts while in
          the background. On some devices, this will also improve the reliability of backtrack and weather monitor
          (though shouldn't be needed on most devices).
          <br>
          <small>
            <strong>When denied</strong>: If you travel and do not open Trail Sense, but have Sunset Alerts enabled, the
            times will likely be inaccurate.
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Physical activity</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to use your phone's pedometer for distance calculation.
          <br>
          <small>
            <strong>When denied</strong>: The pedometer will not work.
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Camera</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to use your camera on the sighting compass, clinometer, and for
          taking photos used by the Cloud Scanner, QR Code Scanner, and Photo Maps.
          <br>
          <small>
            <strong>When denied</strong>: You will not be able to use the sighting compass, camera clinometer, or QR
            Code Scanner. You will need to pick an existing photo to use for the Cloud Scanner or Photo Maps.
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alarms & reminders</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to post a notification at an exact time. This is used
          by the Clock tool (when updating system time) and Sunset Alerts.
          <br>
          <small>
            <strong>When denied</strong>: The clock and sunset alerts may not be accurate.
          </small>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Non-sensitive permissions (can't be denied)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Run at startup</strong>:  Allows Trail Sense to restart when you reboot your device. This will re-enable backtrack, weather monitor, and several other background services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Run foreground service</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to start foreground services, such as backtrack and weather monitor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flashlight</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to control the phone's flashlight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Control vibration</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to vibrate the phone. Used for haptic feedback on dials and on the metal detector tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prevent phone from sleeping</strong>: Allows Trail Sense to reliably run services such as backtrack and weather monitor, especially when the frequency is under 15 minutes.
        </li>
      </ul>
