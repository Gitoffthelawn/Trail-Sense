            <p>
              A practical survival guide for hikers, backpackers, and campers.
              This guide covers the essentials of what to do in a survival
              situation, signaling for help, building a shelter, insulating
              clothing, finding food and water, starting a fire, and predicting
              the weather. This guide purposely excludes advanced bushcraft and
              long term survival skills in an effort to be as practical to the
              average person as possible.
            </p>
