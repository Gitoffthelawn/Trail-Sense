For hikers, the goal of survival is to return safely from an unplanned situation, such as getting lost or injured. This guide will cover essential survival skills needed for these scenarios. It is not a substitute for professional training or experience and should only be used as a reference.

## What to do in a survival situation
If you find yourself in a survival situation, don't panic and follow these steps.

### Stop
If you are lost and not in immediate danger, stop moving. If you continue to move, it will be harder for rescuers to find you.

If you are nervous, take a few deep breaths to calm down. If that doesn't help see the Medical chapter for more tips.

If you have a GPS receiver or smartphone, take note of your current location and place a waypoint or beacon. This will help you find your way back if you move around.

### Think
Take a moment to think about your situation. Look to answer the following questions:
- What are your immediate needs?
- What resources do you have available?
- Did you tell someone your plans before you left? If so, when are they expecting you back?
- Which way did you come from?

### Observe
The next step is to observe your surroundings and assess your situation. Here are some things to observe:
- Check for any potential hazards or resources that could help you.
- Check your smartphone or GPS receiver for a last known location.
- Check your cell phone for a signal.
- Listen for people or vehicles.

### Plan
Make a plan for your next steps. Here's some general advice:
- If it is close to dark, set up a shelter and maybe a fire.
- If you are injured, treat your injuries.
- If you are lost, try to determine your location using a map or GPS.
- If it is hot, find shade and water.
- If it is cold, get warm through insulation, shelter, and fire.
- Tie a bright piece of clothing to a nearby tree and search the nearby area for signs of a trail. Be sure to keep the marker in sight at all times. You may also use a GPS receiver to return to your starting point, just be sure the batteries are charged.
- If you are lost, it may be best to stay put and wait for help. Look to signal for help and make yourself visible to rescuers.

### Act
Once you have a plan, act on it. If at any point you feel unsafe, nervous, or unsure, stop and reassess your situation.

## Signaling for help

### Cell phone
Even if you don't have a signal with your carrier, you may still be able to call emergency services. If you can't make a call, try sending a text message. Check your phone periodically to see if you have a signal, but otherwise keep it off or in airplane mode to conserve battery. You may get a better signal by climbing to higher ground or moving to an open area.

### Whistle
A whistle is a simple and effective signaling device. Three short blasts is the universal signal for help. You may want to cover your ears when using the whistle at full volume.

### Flashlight
At night, a flashlight can be used to signal for help. Use the international distress signal, SOS, which is three short flashes, three long flashes, and three short flashes. If you don't remember the SOS signal, just flash the light repeatedly in groups of three. Aim it in the direction of aircraft or other potential rescuers.
