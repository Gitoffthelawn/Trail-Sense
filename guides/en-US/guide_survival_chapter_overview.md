For hikers, the goal of survival is to return safely from an unplanned situation, such as getting lost or injured. This guide will cover essential survival skills needed for these scenarios. It is not a substitute for professional training or experience and should only be used as a reference.

## Signaling for help

### Cell phone
Even if you don't have a single with your carrier, you may still be able to call emergency services. If you can't make a call, try sending a text message. Check your phone periodically to see if you have a signal, but otherwise keep it off or in airplane mode to conserve battery. You may get a better signal by climbing to higher ground or moving to an open area.

### Whistle
A whistle is a simple and effective signaling device. Three short blasts is the universal signal for help. You may want to cover your ears when using the whistle at full volume.

### Flashlight
At night, a flashlight can be used to signal for help. Use the international distress signal, SOS, which is three short flashes, three long flashes, and three short flashes. If you don't remember the SOS signal, just flash the light repeatedly in groups of three. Aim it in the direction of aircraft or other potential rescuers.
