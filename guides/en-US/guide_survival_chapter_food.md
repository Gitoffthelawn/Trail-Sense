Most people can survive for weeks without food, but without adequate food, the body and mind weaken, making it difficult to perform essential tasks.

## Be prepared
### Gear
**Necessities**:
- Food (enough for the duration of your trip, plus a bit extra). Some good options include:
  - Nuts
  - Seeds
  - Dried fruit
  - Jerky
  - Energy bars
  - Dehydrated meals (with extra water)
  - Canned food (with a can opener if needed)
- Knife or multi-tool
- Bear bag or canister

**Optional**:
- Cooking pot or container
- Utensils (a spork is a good option)
- Cooking stove and fuel

### Knowledge and skills
Start by learning how to do the following:
- Plan your meals for a trip.
- Cook food by boiling or roasting over a fire.
- Use a bear bag or canister to protect your food.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Identify edible plants and mushrooms.
- Find and catch insects, shellfish, crustaceans, fish, and other animals.
- Preserve food.
- Make traps and snares.

## Food essentials

### Caloric and nutritional needs
The average person needs around 2,000 calories per day. You should aim to balance carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in your diet.

- **Carbohydrates**: Provides an immediate source of energy and are found in grains, fruits, and vegetables. Aim for 45-65% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Fats**: Provides long-term energy and are used in essential bodily functions. They are found in meats, oils, nuts, and seeds. Aim for 20-35% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Proteins**: Builds and repairs tissues and are found in meats, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
- **Vitamins and minerals**: Essential for overall health and are found in most foods, but a varied diet is necessary to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients.

### Storage
Food should be stored in airtight containers to prevent spoilage and contamination. Do not pack foods that spoil quickly or require refrigeration.

### Rationing
If you are in a survival situation, you may need to ration your food to make it last longer. A recommended method is to divide your food into thirds. Eat two-thirds of your food during the first half of the time you expect to be lost and save the last third for the second half. It may be difficult to estimate how long you will be lost, but figure around 2 - 3 days after your expected return date, assuming you shared your plans with someone.

### Starvation
Starvation occurs when the body does not receive enough nutrients to function properly. Symptoms include:
- Loss of body fat.
- Difficulty breathing.
- Lower body temperature.
- Reduced muscle mass.
- Fatigue.
- Longer healing time for wounds and illnesses.

## Plants and mushrooms
The safest method for consuming wild plants is through positive identification. Before your trip, it's wise to study local plants through guidebooks or plant identification cards.

### Foraging

Key considerations when choosing plants include:

- **Water safety**: Plants in or near contaminated water must be washed and possibly boiled to avoid consuming harmful bacteria or chemicals.
- **Disease and decay**: Avoid plants that show signs of mildew, fungus, or spoilage.
- **Toxicity variations**: Even within the same species, plants can vary in toxicity due to environmental factors.
- **Personal sensitivities**: If you are sensitive to allergens like poison ivy, steer clear of similar plants such as mangoes or cashews which can cause similar reactions.
- **Caloric / nutritional value**: Some plants are more nutritious than others. For example, nuts and seeds are high in calories and fats, while leafy greens are high in vitamins and minerals.
- **Animal interactions**: Some plants are fine for animals but toxic to humans.
- **Aggregate berries are generally safe**: These include raspberries and blackberries.
- **Seaweed**: Seaweed that is washed onshore may be spoiled or decayed.
- **Avoid the following** unless you are 100% sure of the identification:
  - Mushrooms.
  - Roadside plants.
  - Plants with umbrella-shaped flowers.
  - Plants with milky sap.
  - Plants with shiny leaves.
  - Plants with white, yellow, or red berries.
  - Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods.
  - Plants with a pungent odor.
  - Plants with an almond scent in the leaves or woody parts.
  - Plants with a bitter or soapy taste.
  - Plants with thorns, fine hairs, or spines.
  - Plants that resemble dill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley.
  - Plants with three-leaved growth patterns.

**Edibility testing**

If unsure about a plant and are in extreme need, you can use the Universal Edibility Test to determine its safety:

1. **Smell**: If the plant has an unpleasant odor, do not proceed.
2. **Sap**: Crush or break part of the plant to check for colored or milky sap. Only proceed if the sap is clear.
3. **Skin contact**: Touch the plant's sap or juice to the inner forearm. If there are no ill effects, such as a rash or burning sensation, proceed.
4. **Lip test**: Place the plant's sap or juice on the outer lip for eight minutes. If there are no ill effects, proceed.
5. **Taste test**: Taste a small pinch of the plant and leave it in the mouth for eight minutes. If there's an unpleasant taste or burning sensation, spit it out and rinse your mouth. If there are no ill effects, proceed.
6. **Swallow**: Swallow the small pinch of the plant from step 5. Wait eight hours. If there are no ill effects, proceed.
6. **Eat more**: Eat a handful of the plant and wait another eight hours. If there are no ill effects, the plant is safe to eat. Have restraint when eating large quantities of a new plant, as it may cause digestive issues.

Note that each part of a plant needs to be tested separately, as some parts may be toxic while others are safe.

### Preparation
Wash plants, then cut up into usable pieces. Some plants can be eaten raw, while others need to be cooked.

**Leaching**

Some plants contain toxins that can be removed by leaching. A common example is acorns, which can be shelled and boiled in several changes of water to remove tannins.

## Insects
Insects are a good source of protein, but need to be gathered in large numbers to provide a substantial meal. If you don't want to eat insects, you can use them as bait for fishing or trapping.

### Collection
Rotting logs, under rocks, and in grassy fields are good places to find insects.

Do not eat the following insects:
- Biting or stinging insects.
- Hairy or brightly colored insects.
- Insects with a pungent odor.
- Hairy caterpillars.
- Spiders.
- Ticks.
- Flies.
- Mosquitoes.

Common edible insects include:
- Ants and termites.
- Locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets.
- Dragonflies.
- Bee or wasp larvae.
- Warms and grubs.

Many flying insects can be attracted to a light source at night, making them easier to catch.

### Preparation
Remove the following parts before eating insects:
- Stingers.
- Legs.
- Wings.
- Head.

Cook all insects though any of the cooking techniques in this chapter.

Worms can be placed in water for 15 minutes to purge their digestive tracts. After purging, they can be eaten raw or cooked.

## Shellfish and crustaceans
Shellfish and crustaceans are a good source of protein and can be found in both freshwater and saltwater. They are relatively easy to catch, so make a good survival food source.

### Collection
Search shallow waters, tide pools, and rocky areas for shellfish and crustaceans. Snails and limpets can often be found attached to rocks, which may be easier to get to during low tide.

In freshwater, crayfish can be located in water during the daytime under and around stones in streams or in soft mud. You can attach bait to a string and lower it into the water to attract crayfish. Once it grabs the bait, pull it to shore.

In saltwater, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp can be found near the water's edge or in shallow water. Crabs will also come to shore if you leave bait at the water's edge, where they can be easily caught. Lobsters and crabs are more active at night and shrimp are attracted to light.

Caution, mussels may be poisonous in tropical waters during the summer. If a red tide occurred within 3 days, do not eat fish or shellfish. Do not eat shellfish covered by water during high tide.

### Trapping
A basket fish trap can be used to catch crustaceans. Bait the trap with food and place it in the water. Check the trap every few hours to see if you have caught anything.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/50.webp)

For details on how to construct this trap, see the Fish section of this chapter.

### Preparation
Fully cook clams, mussels, snails, and crawfish to kill parasites. Shellfish can be cooked in their shells.

## Fish
If you are in a longer term survival situation or have access to fishing gear, fish can be a good source of protein and nutrients.

### Fishing
Fish are most active:
- Before a storm.
- Near rocks or logs.
- Under overhanging brush.

There are no poisonous freshwater fish, but there are some poisonous saltwater fish. Most fish are edible.

**Hooks**

See the Crafting chapter for how to make fishhooks.

**Lines**

If you do not have fishing line, you can make it from plant fibers, inner strands of paracord (using a bend knot to join them together), or other strong cordage.

**Poles**

If you do not have a fishing pole, you can make one from a stick, bamboo, or other materials. You can also wrap the line around a short stick and use it as a hand line.

**Bait**

For best results, bait the hooks using insects, worms, or pieces of food.

**Stakeout**

Also known as a trotline, this method involves setting a line with multiple hooks across a stream or river. The line is secured to a tree or stake on each side of the water. Check the line every few hours to see if you have caught anything.

**Gill net**

A gill net is a net that is set in the water to catch fish by their gills. The net is weighted at the bottom and floats at the top. Fish swim into the net and become entangled in the mesh. Check the net every few hours to see if you have caught anything.

A gill net can be made by using the inner strands of paracord or other strong cordage.

1. Tie a suspension line between two sticks.
2. Attach lines to the guide line at intervals.
3. Using overhand knots, form the net.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/48.webp)

For the best results, place the net in a narrow part of the stream or river and near a bend.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/49.webp)

**Traps**

You can construct a basket fish trap by weaving together branches or other materials. Bait the trap with food and place it in the water. Check the trap every few hours to see if you have caught anything. This can also be used to catch crustaceans.

Alternatively, you could use a funnel fish trap by placing sticks into a v-shape with a retaining area at the end. Fish swim into the trap and are unable to find their way out. In tidal areas, you can set up a wall of stones during low tide during the next low tide, fish may get trapped behind the wall.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/50.webp)

### Preparation

1. Remove scales by scraping them off with a knife.
2. Remove entrails by cutting the belly open and pulling them out.
3. Cut into usable pieces or fillet the fish. Alternatively, you could cook the fish whole.
4. Cook the fish.

## Other animals
In a survival situation, it is best to focus on easier to catch animals, such as insects, shellfish, crustaceans, and fish. But if you have the means to catch other animals, they can provide a good source of protein and nutrients.

### Hunting

**Firearms and bows**

If you have a firearm or bow with you, the odds are that you know how to use it. Aim for the vital organs to ensure a quick kill. It is not likely you will be able to construct a survival bow that is effective for hunting.

**Clubs**

A club can be as simple as a stick with a heavy end. This can be used to kill small fish or other animals using a quick, forceful blow to the head.

**Spears and gigs**

A spear can be made by sharpening a stick and optionally hardening the tip in a fire. While it can be thrown, without experience, it is more effective to use it as a thrusting weapon.

For hunting smaller animals, such as frogs, a gig can be made by finding a forked stick and sharpening the ends. Optionally, you can also split the ends of a larger stick and insert smaller sticks to keep the split open.

**Throwing sticks and rocks**

In a pinch, you could use a throwing stick or rock to kill or stun small animals. Aim for the head to ensure a quick kill. The throwing stick can be made by finding a stick with a natural curve that has some weight to it. Throw it like you would throw a boomerang.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/112.webp)

### Trapping

Traps and snares allow for the passive capture of small animals. They can be set up and left alone while you perform other tasks. Be sure to check the traps and snares every few hours to see if you have caught anything.

Look for signs of animal activity, such as tracks, droppings, or chewed vegetation. Set up traps and snares in areas where animals are likely to pass through. You can construct funnels or walls to guide animals into the traps and snares.

Baiting the traps and snares can increase their effectiveness. Use food that is native to the area and that the animals are likely to eat.

Smoking the traps and snares can help mask your scent.

**Snares**

Wire is the best material for snares, but other cordage, such as paracord, can be used. The snare should be set at head height for the animal you are trying to catch. The snare should be set in a loop that tightens when the animal walks through it. Use small twigs to prop the snare open.

To construct a snare:
1. Tie the locking mechanism as shown in the pictures below.
2. Run the cordage/wire through the locking mechanism to form a loop.
3. Attach the other end of the cordage/wire to a tree or stake.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/29.webp)

**Deadfalls**

Deadfall traps are good for catching small animals. They work by dropping a heavy object on the animal when it triggers the trap. The trigger mechanism can be made from a stick and a bait stick. The bait stick is propped up by the trigger stick. When the animal tries to take the bait, the trigger stick is released, causing the heavy object to fall.

Here are some examples of deadfall traps:

### Birds

Without a firearm or bow, birds can be difficult to catch. They are most easily caught at night when they are roosting. You can use a club, throwing stick, or rock to kill or stun the bird.

Also be on the lookout for bird nests, as they may contain eggs.

To prepare a bird for cooking:
1. Pluck features. You can place the bird in boiling water to make this easier. Optionally, you can skin the bird instead, but that will remove some of the fat.
2. Cut open the body cavity and remove the entrails.
3. For larger birds, cut off the feet and cut along the joints to separate out the bird into usable pieces.
4. Cook the bird.

**Notes**:

- Sea birds should be skinned rather than plucked to remove oil glands.
- Scavenger birds, such as vultures, should be boiled for at least 20 minutes to kill parasites.

### Reptiles and amphibians

Reptiles and amphibians are easier to catch than mammals and birds. They can be found moving across open ground. Use a gig or pin it down with a stick, behind the head.

Frogs can be caught near water sources using a gig.

Traps with bait may also be effective for catching reptiles and amphibians.

To clean a snake, cut off the head, then slit the belly and remove the entrails. Skin the snake and cut it into usable pieces. Bury the head to avoid accidentally stepping on it.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/42.webp)

Always wash your hands after handling reptiles and amphibians, as they can carry salmonella. Cook the meat thoroughly.

Do not eat the following:
- Box turtles.
- Hawksbill turtles.
- Brightly colored frogs.
- Frogs with an X on their back.
- Tree frogs.
- Toads.
- Salamanders.

### Small mammals

Small mammals can be caught using traps, snares, or deadfalls. They can also be caught using a club, throwing stick, or rock.

1. Make cuts down the insides of the back legs.
2. Pull the skin off the body like a glove. You will need to sever the head and front feet to remove the skin.
3. Cut the abdominal cavity open and remove the entrails. Be careful not to puncture the intestines.

This guide does not cover the preparation of large mammals, as they are difficult to catch and require a lot of energy to process.

## Cooking

TODO: Utensils and stoves

### Boiling
Boiling preserves the most nutrients in food and is the safest method of cooking. You can use a metal container filled with water suspended over a fire or placed onto hot coals. See the Water chapter for more information on boiling water.

### Roasting
Roasting is a quick and easy method of cooking, but you will get less nutrients from the food. You can roast food on a stick over a fire or place it on hot coals.

### Baking
You can wrap food in leaves or clay and place it in the coals of a fire to bake it. This method is slower than roasting but preserves more nutrients. Do not skin fish or birds packed with clay, as the skin will stick to the clay and can be removed after cooking.

## Preservation
In most survival scenarios, it is best to consume food as soon as possible to avoid spoilage. In a longer term scenario, you can use the following methods to preserve food:

- **Sun drying**: Hang or place on rocks in direct sunlight. Turn the food occasionally to ensure even drying.
- **Smoking**: Hang food over a smoky fire to dry it out. For best results, use a fire with little flame and lots of smoke in a poorly ventilated area.
- **Freezing**: Freeze food in meal-sized portions only if the temperature is consistently below freezing. If the temperature is above freezing, the food may start thawing.
- **Natural refrigeration**: Bury food in snow, underground (lined with grass or leaves), or wrap in a wet cloth.
- **Live storage**: Store fish in a trap or a pen made of rocks and sticks in a stream. Insects can be stored in a container with holes in the lid.

## Protection
You may need to protect your food from animals. Here are some methods to keep your food safe:

### Bear bags
A bear bag is a bag of food that is hoisted up into a tree to keep it out of reach of bears and other animals.

1. Place food in a bag.
2. Tie a rope to the bag.
3. Throw the rope over a high branch and hoist the bag up.
4. Tie the rope to a tree to keep the bag out of reach of animals.

### Bear canisters
A bear canister is a hard plastic container that is used to store food. It is bear-proof and can be used to store food on the ground.

Some campsites may provide a bear box, which is a large metal box that is used to store food.
