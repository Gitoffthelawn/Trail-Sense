- Predict tides

## Weather

### Precipitation
For the most part, you can continue your outdoor activities in light precipitation. However, if it starts precipitating heavily, you should seek shelter. You should be aware of the risk of hypothermia and take steps to stay warm and dry.

Be cautious near rivers and streams during heavy precipitation, as they can rise rapidly and become dangerous.

Blizzards can lead to whiteout conditions, where visibility is severely reduced. If you are caught in a blizzard, seek shelter immediately and stay warm and dry.

### Temperature and humidity
In cold weather, you should dress in layers and wear a hat and gloves to prevent heat loss. Be sure to stay dry, as wet clothing can cause you to lose body heat more quickly.

In hot weather, be sure to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade. Wear sunscreen and sun protective clothing to protect yourself from the sun. High humidity can make it feel hotter in warm weather and make it harder to cool off.

### Wind
When it is cold out, wind can make it feel even colder and increase the risk of hypothermia and frostbite. Be sure to dress in layers and wear a hat and gloves to protect yourself from the wind.

Be sure to look out for unstable trees and branches in windy conditions, as they can pose a hazard.

In desert environments, wind can cause sandstorms, which can reduce visibility and make it difficult to breathe. Be sure to seek shelter during a sandstorm and protect your eyes and mouth using a bandana or other cloth.

Prevailing winds are winds that blow in a consistent direction over a long period of time. While it can change due to local geography and bodies of water, in general:

- 60° N to 90° N: Winds generally blow from the east.
- 30° N to 60° N: Winds generally blow from the west.
- 0° to 30° N: Winds generally blow from the northeast.
- 0° to 30° S: Winds generally blow from the southeast.
- 30° S to 60° S: Winds generally blow from the west.
- 60° S to 90° S: Winds generally blow from the east.

### Fog
Fog can reduce visibility, making it difficult to navigate. If you are hiking in fog, be sure to stay on marked trails and use a map and compass or GPS to navigate. Be sure to watch your footing.

### Lightning
If you are caught outside during a thunderstorm, seek shelter immediately. Avoid tall trees and bodies of water, but get out of the open. If you are out in the open, crouch down on the balls of your feet and cover your ears to reduce the chance of being struck by lightning.

If you feel your hair stand on end or hear a crackling noise, you are in danger of being struck by lightning.

You can estimate how far away a thunderstorm is by counting the seconds between a flash of lightning and the sound of thunder. Divide the number of seconds by 5 to get the distance in miles. One mile is about 1.6 kilometers. Any storm within 6 miles (10 kilometers) is a threat.

### Sun
On days with a high UV index, be sure to wear sunscreen and sun protective clothing. If you are in a hot climate, be sure to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade.

### Smoke
Wildfires can cause smoke that travels long distances. If possible, avoid outdoor activities on days with poor air quality.

## Climate
The climate of a region is the average weather conditions over a long period of time. Understanding the climate of a region can help you prepare for the weather you are likely to encounter over a long period of time.

Some key factors to consider when thinking about the climate of a region include:
- Daily high and low temperatures
- Precipitation amounts
- Humidity levels
- Wind patterns

## Forecasting
You can learn to forecast the weather by observing the signs around you. The more signs you observe, the more accurate your forecast will be.

### Signs of worsening weather
- Cloud cover increases
- Clouds start growing vertically (into an anvil shape)
  - This indicates a thunderstorm
- Clouds darken
- Clouds start moving quickly
- Clouds lower
- Wind speed increases
- Temperature suddenly drops
- Barometric pressure drops
  - The faster it drops, the more severe the weather will likely be
- Wind changes direction, opposite of the prevailing wind
- Animals become quiet
- Humidity increases
- You see lightning or hear thunder
- You may smell rain (called petrichor)

### Signs of improving weather
- Cloud cover decreases
- Wind speed decreases
- Temperature rises
- Barometric pressure rises
- Wind changes direction to match the prevailing wind
- Animals become active
- Humidity decreases

## Tides
Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational forces of the moon and sun. Tides can affect your outdoor activities, especially if you are near the coast.

A receding tide can lead to a rip current, which can be dangerous for swimmers.

Be sure to check the tide tables before heading out to the coast. You can find tide tables online or in local newspapers.

### Semidiurnal tides
Semidiurnal tides have two high tides and two low tides each day. Most locations have semidiurnal tides. If you know the time of the high tide, then the next low tide will be about 6 hours later, and the next high tide will be about 6 hours after that.

**Mixed tides**

Mixed tides are a type of semidiurnal tide, but the heights of the high and/or low tides are different throughout the day.

### Diurnal tides
Diurnal tides have one high tide and one low tide each day. If you know the time of the high tide, then the next low tide will be about 12 hours later, and the next high tide will be about 12 hours after that.

## Night
You can estimate the time until sunset by holding your hand horizontally with fingers together and counting the number of finger widths between the sun and the horizon. Each finger width is roughly 15 minutes.

On days where the moon is nearly full, you can use the moonlight to help see.

Navigating in the dark is not recommended, but if you must, be sure to use a flashlight or headlamp to light your way.
