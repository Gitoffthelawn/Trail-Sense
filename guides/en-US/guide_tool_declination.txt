The Declination tool can be used to determine what declination to set your physical compass to. Trail Sense's compass can be adjusted for declination in Settings > Sensors > Compass (uses true north by default).

## Declination
Once you enter a location (defaults to your last known location), the declination is displayed at the top of the screen. A declination arrow, like the one you may see on a map, is shown in the middle of the screen.
