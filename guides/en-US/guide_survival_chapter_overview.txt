See each chapter for additional knowledge and skills recommendations.

## What to do in a survival situation
If you find yourself in a survival situation, don't panic and follow these steps.

### Stop
If you are lost and not in immediate danger, stop moving. Continuing to move can make it harder for rescuers to find you.

If you are nervous, take a few deep breaths to calm down. If that doesn't help, see the Medical chapter for more tips.

If you have a GPS receiver or smartphone, note your current location and place a waypoint or beacon. This will help you find your way back if you move around.

### Think
Take a moment to think about your situation. Answer the following questions:
- What are your immediate needs?
- What resources do you have available?
- Did you tell someone your plans before you left? If so, when are they expecting you back?
- Which way did you come from?

### Observe
Next, observe your surroundings and assess your situation:
- Check for any potential hazards or resources that could help you.
- Check your smartphone or GPS receiver for your last known location.
- Check your cell phone for a signal.
- Listen for people or vehicles.

### Plan
Make a plan for your next steps. Here's some general advice:
- If it is close to dark, set up a shelter and maybe a fire.
- If you are injured, treat your injuries.
- If you are lost, try to determine your location using a map or GPS.
- If it is hot, find shade and water.
- If it is cold, get warm through insulation, shelter, and fire.
- Tie a bright piece of clothing to a nearby tree and search the nearby area for signs of a trail. Keep the marker in sight at all times. You may also use a GPS receiver to return to your starting point; just ensure the batteries are charged.
- If you are lost, it may be best to stay put and wait for help. Try to signal for help and make yourself visible to rescuers.

### Act
Once you have a plan, act on it. If at any point you feel unsafe, nervous, or unsure, stop and reassess your situation.

## Planning a trip
Proper planning is crucial for a safe and enjoyable hiking experience. Here are some steps to help you prepare:

1. Research the terrain, weather conditions, wildlife, and plants you might encounter. Also, look into local regulations and any permits you may need.
2. Using a map, plan your route. Be sure to consider trail conditions and alternate routes.
3. Pack the necessary gear and supplies. See the "Be prepared" section for a list of essential items. Check all your gear before you leave.
4. Check the weather forecast and adjust your plans accordingly.
5. Share your itinerary with a trusted person. Include your planned route, expected return time, and check-in times.

## Signaling for help

### Cell phone
Even if you don't have a signal with your carrier, you may still be able to call emergency services. If you can't make a call, try sending a text message. Check your phone periodically to see if you have a signal, but otherwise keep it off or in airplane mode to conserve battery. You may get a better signal by climbing to higher ground or moving to an open area.

### Whistle
Three short blasts are the universal signal for help. You may want to cover your ears when using the whistle at full volume.

### Signal mirror
Hold the mirror with one hand and extend your other arm in front of you with your fingers in a V-shape. Reflect sunlight onto your fingers and slowly move the mirror to direct the reflected light toward potential rescuers or aircraft.

### Smoke
Smoke can attract attention during the day. You can create a lot of smoke by burning green vegetation. Be sure to do this safely.

### Flares
Flares are best seen at night or in low-visibility conditions. Follow the instructions on the flare packaging and be aware of any legal restrictions on their use.

### Flashlight
At night, a flashlight can be used to signal for help. Use the international distress signal, SOS, which is three short flashes, three long flashes, and three short flashes. If you don't remember the SOS signal, flash the light repeatedly in groups of three. Aim it in the direction of aircraft or other potential rescuers.

### Ground-to-air signals
Ground-to-air signals are large markers you create on the ground to communicate with aircraft. Use rocks, logs, or other materials to create a large "V" (means you require assistance) or an "X" (means you require medical assistance). Use contrasting or artificial colors to make the signal more visible.
