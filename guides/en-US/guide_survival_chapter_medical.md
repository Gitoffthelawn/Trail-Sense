## Allergic reactions
TODO: Add content

### Symptoms

### Treatment

### Prevention

## Altitude sickness
Altitude sickness is caused low oxygen levels at high altitudes.

### Symptoms
- Headache.
- Nausea.
- Fatigue.
- Dizziness.
- Shortness of breath.
- Poor sleep.
- Loss of appetite.
- Rapid heartbeat.
- Coughing.

### Treatment
- Pain relievers for headache (ibuprofen).
- Do not ascend until symptoms are gone.
- Descend to a lower altitude if symptoms are severe or do not improve within a day.

### Prevention
- Ascend slowly.
- Acclimate to the altitude before ascending further.
- Look out for symptoms if traveling above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).

## Bites / attacks: mammals and other animals
Many animals bite when they feel threatened or cornered. Some animals can transmit diseases through their bites.

### Treatment
1. Wash the wound with soap and water.
2. Apply antibiotic ointment.
3. Cover the wound with a bandage. Pack the wound with gauze if it is deep, but do not suture or tape it closed.
4. Seek medical attention if the wound is deep, bleeding, or shows signs of infection.

If you were bit by a mammal, seek medical attention as soon as possible. You may need rabies shots.

### Prevention
- Do not approach or corner wild animals.
- Do not feed wild animals.
- Use a bear bell or make noise to alert animals of your presence.
- Stay clear of any animal with young nearby.
- If an animal is approaching you (most animals):
  - Do not turn and run. It may trigger a chase response.
  - Make yourself look big.
  - Make noise, but do not make high-pitched screams.
  - Pick up children and small pets.
  - Back away slowly or move sideways.
  - Use bear or pepper spray if available.
  - Fight back if attacked (except for grizzly/brown bears - see next point). Use knives, sticks, rocks, or your hands. Aim for the eyes, nose, or throat.
  - Play dead if it is a grizzly/brown bear attacking. Lay flat on the ground with your hands clasped behind your neck. The exception to grizzly attacks is if it attacks you in your tent, stalks you before attacking, or continues attacking after playing dead. In this case, fight back.
  - Do not drop your pack, as it can provide protection.

## Bites: Snakes
Always be on the lookout for snakes, especially in areas with tall grass, rocks, or logs. Snakes are most active during the day. Most snake bites are not venomous, but if you don't know what kind of snake bit you, treat it as if it is venomous.

### Treatment
1. Rinse the bite area with water.
2. Clean the wound and cover with a bandage.
3. Remove any rings or jewelry from the affected limb.
4. Wrap the limb with a bandage, starting at the bite and moving up the limb. The bandage should be tight but not cut off circulation. You should be able to slip a finger under the bandage.
5. Keep the limb immobilized, as you would a fracture, and below the level of the heart.
6. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. Call the hospital ahead of time so they can prepare antivenom if needed.

Do not do the following:
- Cut the wound.
- Suck out the venom.
- Apply a tourniquet.
- Apply ice.

### Prevention
- Watch where you step.
- Wear high boots.
- Do not put your hands or feet where you cannot see.
- Do not try to catch or kill snakes unless you are sure they are not venomous.

## Bites / stings: bugs
Many insects can bite or sting you, causing pain, swelling, and itching. Some insects can also transmit diseases.

### Symptoms
- Itching.
- Swelling.
- Redness.

### Treatment

**Ticks**

Using tweezers if available, grasp the tick where it is attached to the skin and pull straight out with steady, even pressure. Do not twist or jerk the tick. Do not squeeze the tick's body. Treat as you would a bug bite.

***Leaches***

To remove a leach:
1. Pull it taut (but not too tight).
2. Slide a fingernail or other flat object between the leach and your skin to detach it.
3. Flick the leach away before it can reattach.
4. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.
5. Apply a bandage to control bleeding. It is normal for the wound to bleed for a while.

Do not salt, burn, or pull the leach off, as this can cause the leach to regurgitate into the wound.

***Bites***

Avoid scratching and apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to reduce itching. You can use a cloth soaked in cold water or filled with snow/ice to reduce swelling.

***Stings***

Remove any stingers, taking care not to squeeze the venom sac. Treat as you would a bug bite.

**Bugs in eyes**

See the section on objects in the eye.

### Prevention
- Use insect repellent.
- Wear long sleeves and pants.
- Wrap your face with a bandana.
- Wear glasses / sunglasses (keeps bugs out of your eyes).
- Use a bug net.
- Check for ticks / leeches frequently.
- Ensure your immunizations are up to date for bug-borne diseases in the area.

You can make an improvised bug repellent by applying mud to your skin or using the smoke from a fire.

### Treatment

### Prevention

## Choking
If you are choking and someone is nearby, place your hands on your throat to signal that you are choking.

### Treatment
Perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself by doing the following:
1. If possible, bend over a hard surface.
2. Make a fist with one hand.
3. Place the thumb side of your fist against your abdomen, below your ribcage and above your navel.
4. Grasp your fist with your other hand and press into your abdomen with a quick upward thrust.

Perform the Heimlich maneuver on someone else by doing the following:
1. Stand behind the person.
2. Reach around the person's waist.
3. Make a fist with one hand.
4. Place the thumb side of your fist against the person's abdomen, below the ribcage and above the navel.
5. Grasp your fist with your other hand and press into the person's abdomen with a quick upward thrust.


## Cramps
Cramps are caused by muscle spasms and can be caused by dehydration, overexertion, or lack of electrolytes.

### Symptoms
- Muscle pain.
- Muscle spasms.
- Muscle weakness.

### Treatment
- Gently stretch the muscle.
- Massage the muscle.
- Apply heat or cold to the muscle.
- Drink water or an electrolyte solution with salt (sodium chloride) and potassium chloride.
- Eat salty foods.
- Eat potassium-rich foods (bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, spinach, and lentils).
- Slow down or stop physical activity.

### Prevention
- Stay hydrated.
- Replenish electrolytes.
- Warm up before physical activity.
- Stretch before and after physical activity.
- Maintain a slow and steady pace.

## Dehydration

### Symptoms
- Thirst.
- Dry mouth and throat.
- Fatigue.
- Dizziness.
- Dark urine.
- Reduced urine output.
- Dry skin.
- Headache.
- Confusion.

### Treatment
Rehydrate by drinking water, an electrolyte solution, or tea.

### Prevention

## Embedded fishhooks
Fishhooks are designed to penetrate flesh and are difficult to remove without causing further injury. Unless you need to remove the hook to prevent further injury, it is best to leave the hook in place and seek medical attention.

### Treatment
Do not attempt to remove a fishhook if it is embedded in the eye.

**Method 1**

1. Advance the hook through the skin until the barb is exposed.
2. Cut the barb off with wire cutters, such as those on a multitool or pliers.
3. Pull the hook out in the opposite direction it entered, it should come out easily.
4. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

**Method 2**

1. Run a piece of fishing line or cordage through the bend of the hook.
2. Grab the ends of the string.
3. Apply downward pressure on the eye of the hook.
4. Quickly pull the string, causing the hook to come out the way it went in.
5. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/hook_removal.webp)

### Prevention
- Be careful when handling fishhooks.
- Use a barbless hook if possible (these don't work as well when fishing).

## Fractures
A fracture is a broken bone. A fracture can be closed (bone is broken but skin is intact) or open (bone is broken and protruding from the skin).

### Symptoms
- Pain.
- Swelling.
- Bruising.
- Deformity.
- Loss of function.
- Inability to bear weight.
- Bone protruding from the skin.

### Treatment
If the bone is out of place and you will not be able to receive medical attention within several hours, you may need to set the bone. Otherwise, splint the bone in place and seek medical attention.

**Setting a bone**

1. Irrigate and clean the wound if the bone is protruding.
2. Grab the limb below the fracture.
3. Pull the limb to straighten the bone. It may pop into place and pain may decrease.
4. Splint the bone while holding the bone in place.
5. Cover the open wound with a sterile dressing and bandage.

**Splinting a bone**

1. Remove all jewelry and tight clothing from the area.
2. Apply padding around the fracture.
3. Construct a splint using a rigid object (such as a stick, trekking pole, or tent pole). It should extend past the bone break on both sides.
4. Secure the splint in place with bandages, tape, or cordage. The splint should be tight but not cut off circulation. If splinting a finger, tape it to the finger next to it.
5. Apply a sling if the fracture is in the arm to help immobilize the limb.
