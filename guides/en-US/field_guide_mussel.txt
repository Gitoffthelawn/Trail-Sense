Mussel
A bivalve mollusk with an elongated shell, usually attached to rocks or other hard surfaces along the shoreline. Mussels are found in both saltwater and freshwater. Many species are edible, but mussels can retain toxins from the water, especially during summer months, so only those harvested from clean sources should be consumed.
