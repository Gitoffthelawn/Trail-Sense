This chapter explains how to make a fire in a survival situation.

## Be ready

### Gear
**Important items**:
- Fire starter (carry at least two types: waterproof matches, lighters, or fire steel)

**Optional**:
- Tinder (dryer lint, cotton balls, or store-bought fire starters)

### Knowledge and skills
Learn how to:
- Make a fire using different fire starters (matches, lighters, fire steel).
- Find and prepare tinder, kindling, and fuel.
- Keep a fire going.
- Put out a fire.
- Start a fire in wet conditions.

Once you know these skills, learn how to:
- Protect a fire from wind and rain.
- Make and use a bow drill.
- Make charcoal (see the Crafting chapter).
- Make a fire bundle and use it to start a fire.

## Making a fire

### Choosing a place
- Pick a flat, dry area that is safe from the wind, near your shelter and fuel.
- Clear the ground to remove things that can catch fire.
- In snow, build your fire on green logs to keep it above the snow.

### Fire reflector (optional)
A fire reflector is a wall behind the fire that directs heat toward you and protects the fire from wind. Make it with rocks, logs, or snow before lighting the fire.

### Getting materials

- **Tinder**: Small, dry materials that catch fire easily. Dry out wet tinder by keeping it near your body or in a sleeping bag.
  - Shredded tree bark (birch, cedar, chestnut, red elm)
  - Small wood shavings
  - Fatwood (resin-rich wood from pine trees, found at the base of dead branches)
  - Dry grass, leaves, or pine needles
  - Dry powdered pine tree sap
  - Seed fluff (cattail, milkweed, thistle)
  - Feather sticks (shaved wood attached to a stick)
  - Store-bought fire starters
  - Cotton balls (best if covered in petroleum jelly)
  - Lint
  - Paper
  - Special fungi like tinder fungus or chaga

- **Kindling**: Small sticks that help build the flame.
  - Sticks and twigs (as thick as a pencil or finger)
  - Thin split wood
  - Plastic items like straws or spoons
  - Wood with liquid that burns easily (use carefully)

- **Fuel**: Larger wood pieces that burn for a long time and keep the fire going.

### Fire structures

- **Tepee**: Put a bundle of tinder in the center and build a cone of kindling around it. This is easy to light and works well in wet conditions.
- **Lean-to**: Place a long green stick at an angle in the ground and lean kindling against it. Put the tinder underneath.
- **Cross-ditch**: Dig an X in the ground and place tinder in the center. Build a small pyramid of kindling over it. The ditch allows air to reach the fire.
- **Pyramid**: Stack small logs in layers. Start the fire at the top. This burns slowly and needs less attention.

## Starting a fire

- **Matches/lighters**: Always carry waterproof matches or a lighter.
- **Fire steel**: Works in all weather. Scrape it quickly with a knife or metal tool to make sparks. Hold it close to or pin it against the tinder, then scrape it quickly toward the tinder.
- **Magnifying glass/lens**: Use sunlight to focus heat onto tinder. Glasses or a water-filled clear bottle can work. Needs strong sunlight and may take some time.

- **Flint and steel**: Hit a steel tool against flint rock to make sparks. The tinder must be very dry.
- **Bow drill**: Spin a wooden stick (drill) on a wooden base (fireboard) using a bow to create heat and an ember.
- **Hand drill**: Spin a stick between your hands against a fireboard while pushing down.

### Making a bow drill
- **Socket**: A small, hard object (rock or wood) to press down on the drill. It should have a small hole to fit the top of the drill.
- **Drill**: A straight, dry stick about 10-12 inches long and ¾ inch thick.
- **Fireboard**: A dry, flat piece of softwood with a notch to catch embers. Use wood like yucca, tamarack, aspen, balsam fir, basswood, poplar, cypress, cottonwood, alder, red cedar, or willow. Make a small hole about ½ to ¾ inch from the edge. Cut a V-shaped notch leading to it so the ember has space to grow.
- **Bow**: A flexible, curved stick with a string or rope (like a shoelace) tied to both ends.
- **Fire pan**: A piece of bark or wood to catch embers.

Use the bow to spin the drill on the fireboard until you create an ember. Use your foot to keep the fireboard in place. Place the ember in a tinder bundle and blow gently to ignite.

## Keeping and putting out a fire

**Keeping it going**: Add fuel as needed. Change the structure to control heat and burn speed.

**Putting it out**: Pour water on it or cover with dirt. Check for leftover embers and make sure they are cold. Do not bury a fire in sand because it can stay hot and cause burns.

**Safety tips**:
- Never leave a fire alone.
- Follow local fire rules.
- Be ready to put out the fire quickly.
- Put dry rocks, dirt, or sand around the fire pit to stop fires from spreading underground. Do not build over tree roots.

### Moving a fire

**Carrying heat**
If you want warmth for longer, heat rocks **near** the fire and place them in your shelter. Do not let them get too hot. Check before touching.

You can also heat water and put it in a container to keep warm.

**Fire bundle**
A fire bundle is a way to carry a fire to a new place without starting over. Wrap a hot ember in dry wood, damp plants, and bark to carry it.

**Tinder fungus and chaga**
These fungi can stay hot for hours. Carry them to a new location and use them to start a fire by placing the ember in a tinder bundle and blowing gently.
