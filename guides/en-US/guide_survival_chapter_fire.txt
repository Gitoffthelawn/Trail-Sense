This chapter covers how to make a fire.

## Be prepared
<!-- K: prepare, gear, knowledge, skill, starter, matches, lighter, steel, ferro, ferrocerium, tinder -->
<!-- S: Bring a fire starter. Learn how to build and maintain a fire. -->

### Gear
**Necessities**:
- Fire starter (waterproof matches, lighters, or fire steel - carry at least two different types)

**Optional**:
- Tinder (dryer lint, cotton balls, or commercial fire starters)

### Knowledge and skills
Start by learning how to do the following:
- Build a fire using multiple fire starters (matches, lighters, fire steel).
- Gather and prepare tinder, kindling, and fuel.
- Maintain a fire.
- Extinguish a fire.
- Build a fire in wet conditions.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Protect a fire from wind and rain.
- Construct and use a bow drill.
- Make charcoal.
- Construct a fire bundle and start a fire with it.

## Preparing a fire site
<!-- K: build, gather, prepare, tinder, kindling, fuel, location, fatwood -->
<!-- S: Choose a flat, dry area protected from the wind. Gather tinder, kindling, and fuel. -->

- Choose a flat, dry area protected from the wind, close to your shelter and a fuel supply.
- Clear the ground to expose soil and remove any flammable materials to prevent unintended spreading.
- In snowy conditions, use a platform of logs to build the fire on.
- If possible, line the fire pit with dry rocks, dirt, or sand to prevent underground fires. Do not construct a fire pit over a root system or peat.
- Some areas may ban the construction of fires, so be aware of local laws and regulations.

### Fire reflector (optional)
A fire reflector is a wall built behind the fire to reflect heat towards you and protect the fire from wind. Use rocks, logs, or snow to build a barrier. It is easier to build a reflector before starting the fire.

### Gathering materials

- **Tinder**: Dry, fine materials that catch fire easily. You can dry out damp tinder by placing it near your body or in your sleeping bag.
  - Shredded inner bark (birch, cedar, chestnut, red elm)
  - Fine wood scrapings or shavings
  - Fatwood: Resin-rich wood from pine trees, typically found at the base of dead branches.
  - Dry grass, leaves, or pine needles
  - Dry powdered sap from pine trees
  - Crushed fibers from dead plants
  - Seed down (cattail, milkweed, thistle)
  - Feather sticks (wood shavings attached to a stick)
  - Commercial fire starters
  - Cotton balls (preferably soaked in petroleum jelly)
  - Lint
  - Paper
  - Tinder fungus or chaga
- **Kindling**: Small sticks and twigs that catch fire from the tinder and help build the flame.
  - Sticks and twigs (pencil to finger thickness)
  - Thinly split wood
  - Plastics, such as straws or spoons
  - Wood soaked in a flammable liquid such as bug spray (use caution)
- **Fuel**: Larger pieces of wood that will burn longer and sustain your fire.
  - Prefer fallen wood that you can break by hand
  - To break a larger piece of wood, insert it between two live trees at the point you want to break it and push it to the side until it snaps

## Starting a fire
<!-- K: start, light, ignite, matches, lighters, steel, ferro, ferrocerium, magnesium, flint, bow-drill, hand-drill, drill, magnifying, lens, tepee, structure -->
<!-- S: If you have a fire starter, use it. You can improvise if required, but it will be more difficult and requires practice. -->

1. Have a sufficient supply of tinder, kindling, and fuel nearby.
2. Form the tinder into a small bundle or nest and place it on the ground.
3. Lean a few pieces of kindling against the tinder in a tepee shape.
4. Light the tinder.
5. Carefully add kindling to the fire, being careful not to smother the flame by always leaving a section with open flame exposed. Blow into it to encourage growth.
6. Once your fire is steady, start adding fuel while trying to maintain a tepee structure.

**Note**: When blowing into a fire, be gentle and take breaths away from the smoke.

### Nursing an ember
An ember is a small piece of tinder that is burning, but has not formed a flame. Once you have an ember, gently blow into it and feed it more tinder until a flame appears.

Sometimes it is easier to hold the tinder containing an ember and cup your hands closer together to find the right balance of oxygen and fuel.

### Fire starters

- **Matches/lighters**: Always have waterproof matches or a reliable lighter in your kit. These are the easiest methods of starting a fire: just put the flame to the tinder.
- **Fire steel**: Durable and works in all weather conditions, producing sparks to ignite your tinder. Scrape it quickly with the back of a knife or scraper to create sparks. For best results, pin the fire steel against the tinder and ground and scrape the steel towards the tinder. Some fire steel comes with a magnesium block, which you can scrape off shavings into the tinder before striking to help cactch a spark.
- **Magnifying glass / lens**: Focus sunlight through a lens onto tinder to create an ember. Glasses or even a clear bottle filled with water can work. This will take a while and requires direct sunlight. Credit card sized freznel lenses are also effective.

The following methods are more difficult to create a fire with and require practice. If you find yourself here, it may be best to focus on insulation and shelter to stay warm.

- **Flint and steel**: Strike a flint rock with a steel tool to create sparks. The tinder must be very dry and fine.
- **Bow drill**: Create friction by spinning a stick (drill) on a wooden base (fireboard) using a bow to rotate the drill.
- **Hand drill**: Create friction by spinning a stick (drill) between your hands on a wooden base (fireboard). Apply downward pressure while spinning.

### Using a bow drill
1. Create the socket by finding a small, flat stone or piece of hardwood with a small depression near the center.
2. Create the drill by finding a straight, dry stick about 10-12 inches long and ¾ inch in diameter.
3. For the fireboard, find a flat, dry piece of soft wood. Yucca, tamarack, aspen, balsam fir, basswood, poplar, cypress, cottonwood, alder, red cedar, and willow are preferred. Avoid resinous woods like pine.
4. Carve a small dpression about ½ to ¾ inch from the edge of the fireboard.
5. On the underside of the fireboard, make a V-shaped cut from the edge of the board to the depression.
6. Find a curved stick that can be used for the bow. It should be about 12-14 inches long and ½ inch in diameter.
7. Attach a cord or shoelace to both ends of the bow.
8. Fire the fire pan, a flat piece of bark or wood to catch the ember.
9. Wrap the drill into the bow string so that it can roll as it moves along the string.
10. Place the fireboard on top of the fire pan so the V-shaped is touching.
11. Place the drill (attached to the bow) into the depression you carved into the fireboard.
12. Place the depression in the socket onto the top end of the drill and apply downward pressure with your non-dominant hand.
13. Place your foot onto the fireboard (same side as non-dominant hand) and rest the hand holding the socket onto your knee.
14. With your dominant hand, start moving the bow side to side to cause the drill to spin. Be sure to go the full length of the bow string. Keep a steady, fast pace.
15. You will start to see smoke after a while, keep going until you are sure there's an ember created.
16. The ember should be transfered onto the fire pan (it may already be there), and moved to a tinder bundle where you can nurse it into a fire.

If you are using a hand drill, follow the same steps as the bow drill except don't create the bow and socket and instead roll the drill between your palms until your reach the bottom, then start again from the top.

## Extinguishing or moving a fire
<!-- K: extinguish, safety, transport, move, bundle, tinder-fungus, chaga -->
<!-- S: Thoroughly extinguish your fire with water or dirt. -->

Thoroughly extinguish your fire by dousing it with water or covering it with dirt.

- Never leave a fire unattended.
- Make sure no embers remain that could reignite or cause a wildfire.
- Always have a plan to extinguish the fire quickly if needed.
- On a beach, do not cover the fire with sand, as it can insulate the heat and cause burns.

### Moving the fire

**Transporting heat**

If you want the heat from your fire to last longer, heat rocks **near** the fire and place them in your shelter or sleeping area. Don't let the rocks get too hot (they should be warm to the touch) to avoid burns or fires. Be sure to check how hot the rocks are before touching them.

Alternatively, you could heat water and place it in a container or bottle to keep you warm.

**Fire bundle**

A fire bundle is a portable fire that can be carried to a new location. It is made by wrapping a burning ember or coals in a bundle of dry punk wood and damp plant matter, contained in bark. This allows you to transport a fire without needing to start a new one from scratch.

You can also use tinder fungus or chaga as a self contained fire bundle, as the inside will hold an ember for hours.

## Craft: charcoal
<!-- K: charcoal, filter, coal, craft -->
<!-- S: You can make charcoal by not allowing wood to fully burn. -->

Charcoal is made by preventing wood from completely burning. It can be used for filtering water, making pitch, medicine, and as fuel for fires. You can grind charcoal into powder by placing it in a container and crushing it with a stick or rock.

**Resources**
- Wood
- Water or dirt

**Instructions**
1. Burn a fire down to coals.
2. Douse the fire with water or dirt to quickly extinguish it.
3. Wait for the coals to cool, there should be some charcoal among the ashes. Charcoal is very light and entirely black.
