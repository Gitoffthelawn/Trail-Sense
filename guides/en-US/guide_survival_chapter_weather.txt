### Knowledge and skills
Start by learning how to do the following:
- Read a weather forecast.
- Deal with different types of weather.
- Identify signs of worsening weather.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Identify signs of improving weather.
- Forecast weather based on observations.
- Understand your region's climate.
- Predict tides.

## Weather
<!-- K: storm, precipitation, rain, snow, hail, sleet, temperature, humidity, wind, fog, lightning, sun, smoke, wildfire, uv, uv-index, thunder, thunderstorm -->
<!-- S: Take shelter during severe storms. Be prepared for various conditions, such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and strong wind. -->

Weather conditions can change rapidly and significantly impact your outdoor activities.

In mountainous regions, take extra precautions when above the tree line, as weather can be more severe and you are more exposed to the elements.

### Precipitation
You can generally continue outdoor activities in light precipitation. However, if it starts precipitating heavily, seek shelter. Be aware of the risk of hypothermia, and take steps to stay warm and dry.

Be cautious near rivers and streams during heavy rainfall, as they can rise rapidly and become dangerous.

Blizzards can lead to whiteout conditions, severely reducing visibility. If caught in a blizzard, seek shelter immediately and stay warm and dry.

### Temperature and humidity
In cold weather, dress in layers and wear a hat and gloves to prevent heat loss. Stay dry, as wet clothing can cause you to lose body heat more quickly.

In hot weather, stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade. Wear sunscreen and sun-protective clothing to protect yourself from sun exposure. High humidity can make it feel hotter and make cooling off more difficult.

Temperature decreases by about 3.5°F (2°C) for every 1,000 feet (305 meters) of elevation gain.

### Wind
Wind can make cold conditions feel even colder, increasing the risk of hypothermia and frostbite. Dress in layers and wear a hat and gloves to protect yourself from the wind.

Be cautious of unstable trees and branches in windy conditions, as they can be hazardous.

Wind can cause sandstorms in desert environments, reducing visibility and making breathing difficult. Seek shelter during a sandstorm and protect your eyes and mouth with a bandana or cloth.

Prevailing winds are winds that blow consistently in one direction over time. While local geography and bodies of water can affect wind patterns, general patterns are as follows:
- 60° N to 90° N: Winds generally blow from the east.
- 30° N to 60° N: Winds generally blow from the west.
- 0° to 30° N: Winds generally blow from the northeast.
- 0° to 30° S: Winds generally blow from the southeast.
- 30° S to 60° S: Winds generally blow from the west.
- 60° S to 90° S: Winds generally blow from the east.

These directions also indicate where the weather will most likely come from. For example, if you are at 40° N and see a thunderstorm to the west, it will likely arrive at your location soon.

### Fog
Fog reduces visibility, making navigation difficult. If hiking in fog, stay on marked trails and use a map, compass, or GPS to navigate. Watch your footing carefully.

### Lightning
If caught outdoors during a thunderstorm, seek shelter immediately. Avoid tall trees and bodies of water, but get out of open areas. If you're in an open area, crouch down on the balls of your feet and cover your ears to reduce the risk of lightning strikes.

If you feel your hair stand on end or hear a crackling noise, you are in danger of being struck by lightning.

You can estimate how far away a thunderstorm is by counting the seconds between a flash of lightning and the sound of thunder. Divide the number of seconds by 5 to get the distance in miles. One mile is about 1.6 kilometers. Any storm within 6 miles (10 kilometers) is a threat.

### Sun
Wear sunscreen and sun-protective clothing on days with a high UV index. In hot climates, stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade.

### Smoke
Wildfires can cause smoke to travel long distances. If possible, avoid outdoor activities on days with poor air quality.

## Climate
<!-- K: climate, average -->
<!-- S: Your region's climate can indicate what weather is common for the time of year. -->

The climate of a region refers to its average weather conditions over time. Understanding the climate helps you prepare for the typical weather you'll encounter.

Key factors to consider when thinking about climate include:
- Daily high and low temperatures
- Precipitation amounts
- Humidity levels
- Wind patterns

## Forecasting
<!-- K: forecast, predict, signs, worsen, improve, cloud, cumulus, cirrus, cumulonimbus, altocumulus, stratus, altostratus, clear, cirrostratus, nimbostratus, cirrocumulus -->
<!-- S: Signs of worsening weather include increasing cloud cover, darkening skies, strong wind, and sudden drops in temperature. -->

You can learn to forecast weather by observing the signs around you. The more signs you notice, the more accurate your forecast will be. Identifying the cloud type can improve your ability to forecast weather. The main cloud types are available in the Field Guide.

### Signs of worsening weather
- Cloud cover increases
- Clouds start growing vertically (into an anvil shape)
  - This indicates a thunderstorm
- Clouds darken
- Clouds move quickly
- Clouds lower
- Wind speed increases
- Temperature suddenly drops
- Barometric pressure drops
  - Faster drops indicate more severe weather
- Wind direction changes to be opposite the prevailing wind
- Animals become quiet
- Humidity increases
- You see lightning or hear thunder
- You smell rain

### Signs of improving weather
- Cloud cover decreases
- Wind speed decreases
- Temperature rises
- Barometric pressure rises
- Wind direction changes to match the prevailing wind
- Animals become active
- Humidity decreases

## Tides
<!-- K: tide, water, coast, rise, fall, moon, ocean, sea, semidiurnal, diurnal, mixed -->
<!-- S: Most places have two high tides and two low tides daily. Check tide tables before heading to the coast. -->

Tides can affect outdoor activities near the coast. A receding tide can lead to rip currents, which are dangerous for swimmers.

Check the tide tables before heading to the coast. Tide tables can be found online or in local newspapers.

### Semidiurnal tides
Semidiurnal tides have two high tides and two low tides each day. If you know the time of high tide, the next low tide will be about 6 hours later, and the following high tide will be about 6 hours after that.

**Mixed tides**

Mixed tides are a type of semidiurnal tide, but the heights of the high and/or low tides vary throughout the day.

### Diurnal tides
Diurnal tides have one high tide and one low tide each day. If you know the time of high tide, the next low tide will be about 12 hours later, and the next high tide will be about 12 hours later.

## Night
<!-- K: night, dark, light, moon, stars, flashlight -->
<!-- S: Be aware of when the sun will set to avoid being caught in the dark. Use a flashlight to navigate at night. -->

You can estimate the time until sunset by holding your hand horizontally with your fingers together and counting the number of finger widths between the sun and the horizon. Each finger width represents roughly 15 minutes.

On nights with a nearly full moon, you can use the moonlight to help navigate.

Navigating in the dark is not recommended; if necessary, use a flashlight or headlamp to light your way.
