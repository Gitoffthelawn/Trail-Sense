Water is crucial for anyone spending time in the wilderness, particularly for hikers who might find themselves isolated. Proper hydration, knowing how to find water, and understanding how to make it safe to drink are essential skills for any hiker.

## Be prepared
### Gear

**Necessities**:
- Water (enough for the duration of your trip, plus a bit extra).
  - For longer duration trips, bring a water purification method and plan your route to include water sources.
- Water containers (ensure you have a container that you could boil water in).

**Optional**:
- Water purification method (tablets or filter).
- Cooking pot or container.
- Clear plastic sheet / tarp.

### Knowledge and skills
Start by learning how to do the following:
- Plan your water needs for the trip.
- Locate water sources.
- Purify water by boiling.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Purify water using chemical treatment or filtration.
- Collect water from plants and other sources.
- Collect water using a solar still.
- Boil water using hot rocks.
- Desalinate water.

## Hydration essentials

When hiking, conserving energy while maintaining hydration is vital. Here are some general rules:

- Choose running water.
- Assume surface water is contaminated, always purify it.
- Avoid the following:
  - Snow (without melting).
  - Urine or alcohol.
  - Saltwater.
  - Stagnant water

### Daily water needs

At 70°F (20°C), a hiker needs around 2 to 3 quarts/liters of water per day. This amount increases with physical activity and exposure to higher temperatures.

### Dehydration

Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluids than it takes in. Symptoms include:

- Thirst.
- Dry mouth and throat.
- Fatigue.
- Dizziness.
- Dark urine.
- Reduced urine output.
- Dry skin.
- Headache.
- Confusion.

## Finding water

### Common water sources

- **Rainwater**: Rainwater collected directly in containers does not need purification. However, if it has run over leaves or other surfaces, it should be purified.

- **Snow and ice**: Melt snow and ice before drinking. Avoid eating snow directly as it can lower your core body temperature. Melted snow requires purification.

- **Streams and rivers**: Flowing water is typically safer than stagnant water but still should be purified.

- **Dew**: Collect dew from plants or grass by wringing out a cloth or sponge.

- **Groundwater**: Dig a deep hole and allow water to seep in. This water should be purified before drinking.

### Specific environments

- **Deserts**:
  - **Groundwater**: Look for green vegetation, valleys and low areas, or dry riverbeds.

- **Beaches / sea**:
  - **Groundwater**: Dig a deep hole to allow water to seep in. Should be purified and may need desalination.
  - **Sea water**: Sea water can be desalinated to render it drinkable.
  - **Sea ice**: If it is gray or opaque, it may be salty. Crystalline ice that has a bluish tint is usually safe to melt for drinking water.

### Water from plants

Certain plants can provide water when no open sources are available:

- **Green bamboo**: Shake the bamboo to check for water, then cut it to extract the water inside.
- **Water vines**: Many vines contain drinkable water. These vines are usually soft and easy to cut. Ensure a positive identification of the vine before drinking and ensure the water is clear and odorless.
- **Coconut water**: Green coconuts are best for hydration, as they contain more fluid and less oil.

### Solar stills

**Belowground solar still**

A belowground solar still is a simple device that uses the sun’s heat to draw moisture from the soil or plants, which then condenses on a plastic sheet and can be collected in a container.

1. Dig a bowl-shaped hole in the ground about 3 feet (1 meter) across and 2 feet (0.6 meters) deep.
2. Place a container in the center of the hole. Optionally place plants around the container to increase moisture (do not place in the container).
3. Place a plastic sheet over the hole, securing the edges with rocks or soil.
4. Place a small rock in the center of the sheet, directly over the container.
5. Wait for the sun to heat the ground and evaporate moisture, which will condense on the plastic and drip into the container.

**Transpiration bag**

A transpiration bag is a plastic bag tied around a leafy branch to collect water.

1. Tie a plastic bag around a leafy branch, ensuring that the bag is airtight.
2. Wait for the sun to heat the plant, causing moisture to evaporate and condense on the bag.
3. Collect the water that has condensed inside the bag.

### Desalination

## Making water safe to drink

Always ensure the water you collect is safe to drink. Boiling is the most reliable method, but chemical purification tablets and filters are also effective. If you cannot purify the water immediately, prioritize finding and storing water until you can treat it.

### Purification methods

- **Boiling**: Bring water to a rolling boil for at least one minute. At higher altitudes, boil for 3 minutes. If you do not have a metal container that can be used for boiling, then do the following:
  1. Find another container, dig a hole in the ground and line it with a waterproof material, or craft a bowl (see the Crafting chapter).
  2. Fill the container with water.
  3. Heat rocks in a fire and place them in the water to heat it. DO NOT use rocks with moisture (such as river rocks), as they can explode. Use two sticks in a chopstick fashion to move the rocks.
  4. Replace the rocks with hot ones as needed to keep the water boiling.
- **Chemical treatment**: Use water purification tablets or drops according to the instructions.
- **Filtration**: Use a portable water filter to remove contaminants. If you construct a filter to remove sediment, still purify the water through boiling or chemical treatment. A filter can be constructed by layering grass/rocks, sand, and charcoal (top to bottom) in a container with a hole at the bottom to collect the filtered water.

### Hazards
- **Microorganisms**: Water may contain bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause illness. Boiling water kills most microorganisms, but some may require additional treatment. More likely to be present in stagnant water.
- **Chemicals**: Water may contain chemicals from industrial or agricultural runoff. Purification may not remove all chemical contaminants.
