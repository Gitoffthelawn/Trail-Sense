## Knots for joining rope

### Square knot
Used for tying two ropes of equal diameter together. Be sure to tie a true square knot to prevent slipping, if you reverse the procedure, the knot will slip under strain.

Untie by grasping the bends of the two bights and pulling the knot apart.

### Single sheet bend
Used for tying two ropes of unequal diameter together. This knot will draw tight under light loads but may loosen or slip when the tension is released.

### Double sheet bend
Used for tying two ropes of unequal diameter together. This knot will not slip or draw tight under heavy loads.

## Hitches

### Two half hitches
Used to tie a rope to a timber or pole. The single half hitch is not very secure without load, so use an overhand or the two half hitches instead.

### Timber hitch
Used for moving heavy timbers or poles. You can make a tighter hold on heavy poles for lifting or dragging by combining a timber hitch and half hitch.

### Prussic
Used to tie a short rope around a longer rope in such a manner that the short rope will slide on the other rope if no tension is applied, and will hold if tension is applied on the short rope.

### Diagonal lashing
Used to secure one pole at a right angle to another pole. Can swap with the square lashing if desired.

### Shear lashing
Used for lashing two or more poles in a series.

## Rope construction

### Fibers
You can use the following materials to make rope:
- Grasses and sedges (sedges are stronger)
- Bark or palm fiber

### Twisting
1. Gather the fibers into loosely held strands of even thickness.
2. Twist each strand clockwise.
3. Twist two or more strands together counterclockwise.
4. Repeat the process until you have a rope. If a strand is running out, add more material to it and twist it in.

TODO: Improve this section and maybe put a custom graphic because this one is not very good.

### Braiding
TODO: What terminology should be used here?

1. Make three twisted strands.
2. Cross the right strand over the center strand and under the left strand.
3. Repeat the process with the new rightmost strand.

### Whipping
To prevent the end of a rope from unraveling, wrap the end with a small cord or tape. Whipping can also be used to wrap the handle of a tool.
