This chapter covers how to find and prepare food in a survival situation.

## Be prepared
<!-- K: prepare, gear, knowledge, skill, nuts, seeds, dried, fruit, jerky, energy, bar, mre, can, knife, multitool, multi-tool, bag, canister, utensil, stove, fuel -->
<!-- S: Bring extra food. Learn how to find food and cook in the wilderness. -->

### Gear

**Necessities**:
- Food (enough for the duration of your trip, plus a bit extra). Some good options include:
  - Nuts
  - Seeds
  - Dried fruit
  - Jerky
  - Energy bars
  - Dehydrated meals (with extra water)
  - Canned food (with a can opener if needed)
- Knife or multi-tool
- Bear bag or canister

**Optional**:
- Cooking pot or container
- Utensils (a spork is a good option)
- Cooking stove and fuel

### Knowledge and skills
Start by learning how to do the following:
- Plan your meals for a trip.
- Cook food by boiling or roasting over a fire.
- Use a bear bag or canister to protect your food.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Identify edible plants and mushrooms.
- Find and catch insects, shellfish, crustaceans, fish, and other animals.
- Preserve food.
- Make traps.

## Food essentials
<!-- K: nutrition, caloric, calorie, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, storage, starvation, ration -->
<!-- S: You need around 2,000 calories per day, but you can ration your food to make it last longer. You should properly store your food to avoid spoilage. -->

### Caloric and nutritional needs
The average person needs around 2,000 calories per day. You should aim to balance carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in your diet.

- **Carbohydrates**: Provide an immediate source of energy and are found in grains, fruits, and vegetables. Aim for 45–65% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Fats**: Provide long-term energy and are used in essential bodily functions. They are found in meats, oils, nuts, and seeds. Aim for 20–35% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Proteins**: Build and repair tissues and are found in meats, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
- **Vitamins and minerals**: Essential for overall health and are found in most foods, but a varied diet is necessary to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients.

### Storage

Food should be stored in airtight containers to prevent spoilage and contamination. Do not pack foods that spoil quickly or require refrigeration.

### Rationing

If you are in a survival situation, you may need to ration your food to make it last longer. Eat two-thirds of your food in the first half of your survival situation (about 2-3 days after your expected return date), and the remaining third in the days that follow. Eating your food will give you the energy you need to construct a shelter and plan.

### Starvation

Starvation occurs when the body does not receive enough nutrients to function properly. Symptoms include:
- Loss of body fat.
- Difficulty breathing.
- Lower body temperature.
- Reduced muscle mass.
- Fatigue.
- Longer healing time for wounds and illnesses.

## Plants and mushrooms
<!-- K: plant, mushroom, seaweed, weeds, green, sap, fungus, forage, poison, toxic, leach, berries -->
<!-- S: Only eat plants you can confidently identity as safe and don't eat any mushrooms. Aggregate berries, like raspberries and blackberries, are generally safe. -->

Only eat wild plants that you can positively identify as safe. Before your trip, it's wise to study local plants through guidebooks or plant identification cards. If you are unable to identify plants, just eat bugs and shellfish; eating unknown plants is not worth the small number of calories.

### Foraging

- Aggregate berries are generally edible. These include raspberries and blackberries.
- Plants in or near contaminated water must be washed and cooked to avoid consuming harmful bacteria or chemicals.
- Some plants are more nutritious than others. For example, nuts and seeds are high in calories and fats, while leafy greens are high in vitamins and minerals.
- Some plants are fine for animals but toxic to humans.
- Seaweed washed ashore may be spoiled or decayed.
- Some plants or nuts, such as acorns, should be boiled a few times before eating to leach out toxins.
- **Avoid the following**:
  - Mushrooms.
  - Roadside plants.
  - Plants with umbrella-shaped flowers.
  - Plants with milky sap.
  - Plants with shiny leaves.
  - Plants with white, yellow, or red berries.
  - Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods.
  - Plants with a pungent odor.
  - Plants with an almond scent in the leaves or woody parts.
  - Plants with a bitter or soapy taste.
  - Plants with thorns, fine hairs, or spines.
  - Plants that resemble dill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley.
  - Plants with three-leaved growth patterns.
  - Plants with signs of mildew, fungus, or spoilage.

### Preparation

Wash plants, then cut them into usable pieces. Some plants can be eaten raw, while others need to be cooked.

## Insects
<!-- K: insect, bug, grub, worm, ant, termite, locust, grasshopper, cricket, dragonfly, bait -->
<!-- S: Most insects can be eaten when cooked or used as fishing bait. -->

Insects are a good source of protein but need to be gathered in large numbers to provide a substantial meal. If you don't want to eat insects, you can use them as bait for fishing or trapping.

### Collection

Good places to find insects include rotting logs, under rocks, and in grassy fields. Common edible bugs include ants, termites, locusts, grasshoppers, crickets, dragonflies, grubs and worms. At night, many flying insects can be attracted to a light source.

Do not eat the following:
- Biting or stinging insects.
- Hairy or brightly colored insects.
- Insects with a pungent odor.
- Hairy caterpillars.
- Spiders.
- Anything that feeds off of blood, such as ticks, flies, and mosquitoes.

### Preparation

Remove stingers and optionally the legs, wings, and head before eating insects. Cook all insects using any of the cooking techniques in this chapter.

Worms can be placed in water for 15 minutes to purge their digestive tracts. After purging, they should be cooked before eating.

## Shellfish and crustaceans
<!-- K: shellfish, crustacean, clam, mussel, snail, limpet, crayfish, lobster, crab, shrimp, shell, bait, basket, trap, seafood, algae, tide, coastal, coast -->
<!-- S: Many shellfish and crustaceans are found along the shoreline and most can be eaten when cooked. -->

Shellfish and crustaceans are a good source of protein and can be found in both freshwater and saltwater. They are relatively easy to catch, so they make a good survival food source.

### Collection

Search shallow waters, tide pools, and rocky areas for shellfish and crustaceans. Snails and limpets can often be found attached to rocks, which may be easier to access during low tide.

Crayfish, lobsters, and crabs can be found under and around stones, in soft mud or sand, and may be more active at night. You can catch them using a variety of techniques:

- Attach bait onto a line and lower it into the water. Once it grabs the bait, pull it to shore.
- For crabs, leave bait near the shoreline and catch them by hand or using a spear.
- Use a fish basket trap with bait in it (see the Fish section below).

**Caution**

- Mussels may be poisonous in tropical waters during the summer.
- If a red tide occurred within three days, do not eat fish or shellfish.
- Do not eat shellfish covered by water during high tide.

### Preparation

Fully cook to kill parasites. Shellfish can be cooked in their shells.

## Fish
<!-- K: fish, hook, line, pole, bait, basket, trap, funnel, kill, seafood, meat -->
<!-- S: Most fish are edible once cooked, but will require some fishing gear. -->

If you are in a longer-term survival situation or have access to fishing gear, fish can be a good source of protein and nutrients. Most fish are edible, but be sure to research which fish may be poisonous in your area.

### Fishing

Fish are most active before a storm, near rocks or logs, and under overhanging brush.

**Hooks**

Hooks with barbs are more effective than barbless hooks at keeping fish on the line. For best results, bait the hooks using insects, worms, or pieces of food.

If you need to craft a hook, go with a gorge hook. They are easy to craft and you don't need to manually set the hook. One downside is that any fish caught with a gorge hook will almost certainly die if released. To carve a gorge hook, sharpen both sides of a small section of wood or bone, and taper at the center. Place the hook into the bait.

**Lines**

If you do not have fishing line, you can make it from plant fibers, inner strands of paracord (using a bend knot to join them together), or other strong cordage.

**Pole**

If you do not have a fishing pole, you can tie the line to both the base and tip of a sturdy stick - try to mimic what an actual fishing pole looks like. You can also wrap the line around a short stick and use it as a hand line.

To reduce the effort of fishing, you can tie the line to a tree branch and check on it frequently.

**Traps**

You can construct a basket fish trap by weaving together branches or other materials. Bait the trap with food and place it in the water. Check it every few hours. This can also be used to catch crustaceans.

Alternatively, use a funnel fish trap by placing sticks into a V-shape with a retaining area at the end. Fish swim into the trap and are unable to find their way out. In tidal areas, you can set up a wall of stones during low tide; as the tide recedes, fish may get trapped behind the wall.

### Preparation

1. Once you catch a fish, do not hold or place it near the water before killing it.
2. Kill the fish by hitting it on the head with a club or rock. Use a hard, quick blow. You can then use a knife to cut the gills or pierce the brain to ensure the fish is dead.
3. Remove scales by scraping them off with a knife (tail to head).
4. Remove entrails by cutting the belly open and pulling them out. You can also cut off the head and tail to make this easier.
5. Cut into usable pieces or fillet the fish. If it is a small fish, you can also just cook it whole.
6. Cook the fish.

## Other animals
<!-- K: animal, hunt, bow, trap, deadfall, bird, reptile, amphibian, frog, snake, mammal, skin, kill, meat, butcher, skin -->
<!-- S: Hunting or trapping can be energy consuming and difficult without proper tools. -->

In a survival situation, it's best to focus on easier-to-catch animals like insects, shellfish, crustaceans, and fish. But if you have the means to catch other animals, they can provide a good source of protein and nutrients. Unless you are a hunter with hunting gear, do not try to hunt large animals.

### Hunting

**Clubs**

A club can be as simple as a stick with a heavy end. This can be used to kill fish or other small animals with a quick, forceful blow to the head.

**Spears**

A spear can be made by sharpening a stick and optionally hardening the tip in a fire. Unless you have experience, it's best to stab with the spear instead of throwing it. To make it easier to hit your target, you can construct multiple spear points if you use a forked branch.

**Throwing sticks and rocks**

In a pinch, you can throw a heavy stick or rock to kill or stun small animals. Aim for the head to ensure a quick kill.

### Trapping

Traps allow for the passive capture of small animals. They can be set up and left alone while you perform other tasks. Check them every few hours. Look for signs of animal activity like tracks, droppings, or chewed vegetation. Set up traps in areas where animals are likely to pass through. You can construct funnels or walls to guide animals into them. Baiting the traps can increase their effectiveness. Smoking the traps can help mask your scent.

**Deadfalls**

Deadfall traps work by dropping a heavy object on the animal when it triggers the trap. The trigger mechanism can be made from a stick and a bait stick. When the animal takes the bait, the trigger releases, causing the heavy object to fall. Place one or more of these traps near your shelter to possibly catch mice.

### Birds

Birds are most easily caught at night when roosting or you can eat eggs from nests. Use a club, throwing stick, or rock to kill or stun the bird.

To prepare a bird for cooking:

1. Pluck feathers. You can place the bird in boiling water to make this easier. Optionally, you can skin the bird instead, but that removes some of the fat.
2. Cut open the body cavity and remove the entrails.
3. For larger birds, cut off the feet and separate the bird into usable pieces along the joints.
4. Cook the bird.

**Notes**:

- Sea birds should be skinned rather than plucked to remove oil glands.
- Scavenger birds, such as vultures, should be boiled for at least 20 minutes to kill parasites.

### Reptiles and amphibians

Reptiles and amphibians are easier to catch than mammals and birds. Many can be found basking in open ground, on logs, or at the water's edge. Use a gig or pin them down with a stick behind the head.

Always wash your hands after handling reptiles and amphibians, as they can carry salmonella. Cook the meat thoroughly.

**Do not eat the following**:
- Box turtles.
- Hawksbill turtles.
- Brightly colored frogs.
- Frogs with an X on their back.
- Tree frogs.
- Toads.
- Salamanders.
- Snakes - edible, but may be dangerous to catch.
  - If you kill a snake, cut off and bury its head before cleaning. Never touch the head with your hands, use sticks instead.

### Small mammals

Small mammals can be caught using traps. They can also be caught using a club, throwing stick, or rock.

To prepare a small mammal for cooking:

1. Make cuts down the insides of the back legs.
2. Pull the skin off the body like a glove. You'll need to sever the head and front feet to remove the skin.
3. Cut open the abdominal cavity and remove the entrails. Be careful not to puncture the intestines.

This guide does not cover the preparation of large mammals, as they are difficult to catch and require a lot of energy to process.

## Cooking
<!-- K: cook, boil, roast, bake, utensil, container, stove -->
<!-- S: You should boil, roast, or bake most foods to avoid getting sick. This will require you to start fire or have a portable stove. -->

Do not try to preserve food you catch, just cook and eat it.

### Stoves
Portable stoves are a convenient way to cook food. They can be fueled by wood, alcohol, or gas. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.

Be sure to let the stove cool down before packing it away.

### Boiling

Boiling preserves the most nutrients in food and is the safest method of cooking. You can use a metal container filled with water suspended over a fire or placed onto hot coals. See the Water chapter for more information on boiling water.

### Roasting

Roasting is a quick and easy method of cooking, but you will get fewer nutrients from the food. You can roast food on a stick over a fire or place it on hot coals.

### Baking

You can wrap food in leaves or clay and place it in the coals of a fire to bake it. This method is slower than roasting but preserves more nutrients. Do not skin fish or birds packed with clay, as the skin will stick to the clay and can be removed after cooking.

### Utensils
If you are packing utensils, a spork is a good option. Otherwise, you can use a stick or your hands to handle food. Be sure to wash your hands before and after eating.

## Protection
<!-- K: protect, bear, bag, canister, box -->
<!-- S: Use bear bags or canisters to prevent animals from stealing your food. -->

You may need to protect your food from animals. Here are some methods to keep your food safe:

### Bear bags

A bear bag is a bag of food hoisted into a tree to keep it out of reach of bears and other animals.

1. Place food in a bag.
2. Tie a rope to the bag.
3. Throw the other end of the rope over a high branch and hoist the bag up. You can attach a short stick to the end of the line to give it weight. Use a clove hitch or jam knot to secure the stick.
4. Tie the rope to a tree to keep the bag elevated. Use either a hitch or bowline knot.

For details on how to tie knots, see the Shelter and Clothing chapter.

### Bear canisters

A bear canister is a hard plastic container used to store food. It is bear-proof and can be left on the ground. Some campsites may provide a bear box, which is a large metal box used to store food.

## Craft: Tongs
<!-- K: tongs, craft -->
<!-- S: You can make tongs from green wood. -->

**Resources**
- Green wood

**Instructions**
1. Cut a length of green wood.
2. Split the wood down the middle to create a flat surface.
3. Optionally, carve a small notch in the center of the stick to allow it to bend more easily.
4. Bend the wood in half to create tongs.
