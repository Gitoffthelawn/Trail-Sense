Navigating and moving efficiently is crucial for safety, energy conservation, and increasing the chances of successful recovery or reaching your destination. This guide discusses essential considerations and techniques for land navigation and decision-making in various environments.

## Be prepared
TODO: Mention what gear to bring and how to prepare for navigation.

## Deciding whether to move or stay put

When deciding whether to stay put or move, consider the following factors:

- **Safety and security**: Assess any threats, including natural and human factors that might compromise safety.
- **Resource availability**: Ensure the location has or is near essential resources like water and shelter.
- **Health and capability**: Evaluate physical and mental health; avoid travel if injured or not mentally prepared.
- **Environmental conditions**: Environmental conditions that might impact movement, such as extreme weather or terrain.
- **Recovery likelihood**: Stay put if recovery is likely soon; move if it improves the chances of rescue or meeting basic needs.

## Movement

Proper movement techniques can help conserve energy and maintain speed:

- **Posture and balance**: Keep your body weight balanced over your feet. Use a flat-footed stance to maintain stability.
- **Terrain navigation**: Adjust your movement to the terrain. Use zigzag paths on steep slopes and maintain a bend in your knees when descending to protect your joints.
- **Environmental awareness**: Be aware of natural paths like animal trails which can offer easier travel and potential resources like water.
- **Planning**: Study the terrain and plan your route in advance. Camp early to ensure enough time for shelter construction.

### Environments

**Mountainous / cold**

Consider the following when moving in mountainous or cold environments:

- **Avalanche risk**: Avoid areas prone to avalanches and be cautious when crossing snow-covered slopes.
- **Altitude sickness**: Acclimate to high altitudes to avoid altitude sickness symptoms like headaches, nausea, and fatigue.
- **Wind chill**: Protect against wind chill by wearing appropriate clothing and taking shelter when necessary.
- **Snow travel**: Use snowshoes or skis for easier travel in snowy conditions. Test ice and snow conditions using a pole or stick before stepping.
- **Frozen water**: Avoid walking on frozen water bodies unless you are sure of the ice thickness.

**Desert**

Consider the following when moving in desert environments:

- **Hydration**: Conserve water by traveling during cooler hours and wearing appropriate clothing to reduce sweating.
- **Salt marshes**: Avoid salt marshes, as they can be dangerous and difficult to navigate.
- **Temperature shifts**: Be prepared for temperature shifts between day and night. Wear appropriate clothing to protect against sun exposure and cold nights.
- **Electronics**: Protect electronic devices from extreme heat and direct sunlight.
- **Shadows**: Stick to the shadows to avoid direct sun exposure and reduce the risk of heat exhaustion.
- **Distance**: Distance can be deceiving in the desert (paths look shorter than they actually are); plan your route carefully and carry enough water and supplies.

**Jungle**

Consider the following when moving in jungle environments:

- **Recovery**: It will be harder to find you under a dense canopy.
- **Vegetation**: Move your body with the vegetation rather than fighting against it to reduce energy expenditure.
- **Navigation**: Do not focus on near objects; look for landmarks in the distance to maintain direction.
- **Insects**: Wear protective clothing to avoid insect bites and stings.
- **Wounds**: Treat any wounds and scratches promptly to avoid infection.

### Crossing water

- **Assessment**: Look for the narrowest part of the river or a place where it breaks into several channels.
- **Precautions**: Avoid crossing at areas with strong currents or near ledges that indicate rapids.

## GPS

A GPS device will help you determine your location and navigate to a specific point. However, it is essential to have a backup plan in case the device fails.

### Location

A GPS uses satellites to determine your current location. Ensure the device has a clear view of the sky to receive signals. Most GPS units will display your coordinates in latitude and longitude. This location can be plotted onto a map.

### Waypoints

A waypoint is a specific location you want to navigate to. You can enter waypoints into your GPS device to help guide you to your destination. Most devices will let you enter waypoints before you start your trip, but you can also add them as you go. Be sure to place waypoints frequently so that you can backtrack if needed.

If you are using Trail Sense, you can use the Navigation, Beacons, Paths, and Photo Maps tools to assist with navigation.

### Battery

It is a very real possibility that your GPS device will run out of battery. Be sure to carry extra batteries or a portable charger to keep your device powered.

### Digital maps

If your GPS device supports digital maps, you should download maps of the area you will be traveling in advance. This will allow you to navigate even if you lose a signal.

## Compass

A compass can help you determine which direction you are facing. It is essential to know how to use a compass in conjunction with a map to navigate effectively.

### Bearings

A bearing is the direction you need to travel to reach a specific point. You can determine a bearing by aligning the compass needle with the desired direction on the compass housing. Once you have the bearing, you can follow it to reach your destination. It is best to pick a prominent feature in the distance to navigate towards it to avoid having to constantly check your compass and maintain your bearing.

### Back bearings

A back bearing is the opposite direction of your current bearing. You can use back bearings to retrace your steps. To calculate a back bearing: if your bearing is less than 180 degrees, add 180 degrees. If your bearing is greater than 180 degrees, subtract 180 degrees.

### Declination

Declination is the difference between true north and magnetic north. You will need to adjust your compass to account for declination when navigating with a map. Some compasses have an adjustable declination ring, while others will require you to do the math yourself. Most maps will have the declination listed in the legend and be oriented to true north.

## Map

A map can be used in conjunction with a compass to navigate.

### Orientation

You can orient a map to point north using a compass:
1. Place the compass on the map with the direction of travel arrow pointing towards the top of the map.
2. Rotate the map and compass together until the compass is pointing north.

### Determining location

To determine your location on a map, you will need to identify prominent features around you and match them to the map. You can use a compass to determine which direction you are facing and align the map accordingly.

To triangulate your location on the map:
1. Orient the map to point north using your compass.
2. Identify two prominent features around you and mark them on the map.
3. Measure the bearing to each feature using your compass.
4. Draw lines on the map from each feature in the direction of the bearing.
5. The point where the lines intersect is your location.

### Scale

Maps are drawn to scale, which allows you to determine distances between points. There should be a bar on the map that indicates the scale. Using this along with a ruler, string, stick, or even your finger, you can measure distances on the map.

### Topographic maps

Topographic maps show elevation changes and terrain features. They are useful for navigating in mountainous or hilly terrain. Contour lines on the map indicate elevation changes, and the closer the lines are together, the steeper the terrain. These maps should also list the elevation on some contour lines, which allows you to determine if a point is a peak or valley.

## Advanced navigation techniques

### Sun

- **Shadow tip method**: Place a stick vertically in the ground and mark the shadow tip. Wait 10-15 minutes, mark the new position of the tip, then draw a straight line between the two marks for an east-west line. North will be perpendicular to this line at midday.

- **Watch method**: Point the hour hand of an analog watch at the sun; south is roughly halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock in the Northern Hemisphere. If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, point the 12 o'clock position at the sun instead. If your watch is set to daylight saving time, use the 1 o'clock position instead of 12 o'clock.

### Stars
- **Northern hemisphere**: Identify the North Star (Polaris) using the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia as reference points. Polaris is located at the end of the Little Dipper's handle.

### Environmental cues

- **Vegetation**: Moss often grows more lushly on the more shaded and moist side of trees, which is generally the north side in the Northern Hemisphere and the south side in the Southern Hemisphere.
- **Snow**: On slopes, snow melts more quickly on the side that receives more sun (south-facing in the Northern Hemisphere, north-facing in the Southern Hemisphere).
