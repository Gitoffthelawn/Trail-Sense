A well-constructed shelter can protect you from environmental hazards such as sun, wind, rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. It also boosts morale. This guide focuses on clothing as your primary shelter and details constructing both man-made and natural shelters.

### Knowledge and skills

Start by learning how to do the following:
- Choose clothing appropriate for your environment.
- Use an emergency space blanket.
- Get warm quickly.
- Layer clothing for warmth.
- Set up a tent and sleeping bag.
- Identify environmental hazards when selecting a shelter location.

Once you have mastered these skills, you should learn how to do the following:
- Construct a natural shelter.
- Repair clothing.

## Clothing

Your first line of defense in any environment is your clothing. Proper attire should keep you dry, regulate your body temperature, protect you from the sun, and prevent insect bites.

### Materials
When choosing clothing, consider the following materials:
- Wool: Retains warmth even when wet.
- Polyester/nylon: Quick-drying and moisture-wicking.
- Down: Lightweight and insulating but loses warmth when wet.
- Cotton: Retains moisture and loses warmth when wet. Do not wear cotton in cold or wet environments.

### Layers
You should plan to wear multiple layers of clothing to protect against the elements. Layering allows you to adjust your clothing to changing conditions and maintain body temperature.

In cold environments, remove or add layers as needed to prevent sweating while staying warm.

In warm environments, you may only need to wear a base and middle layer. But you should always pack rain gear, such as an emergency poncho, in case of sudden weather changes.

If you need extra insulation in a pinch, stuff your clothing with dry leaves, grass, or other insulating materials.

- **Base layer**: Wicks moisture away from the skin. This layer should be tight-fitting.
  - Undergarments
  - Socks
  - Pants
  - Shirt
- **Middle layer**: Insulates and retains heat. This layer should be loose-fitting.
  - Sweater
  - Fleece jacket
  - Insulated pants
  - Vest
- **Outer layer**: Protects against wind, rain, and snow. This layer should be loose-fitting.
  - Rain gear
  - Windbreaker
- **Accessories**: Protect against sun, wind, cold, and insects.
  - Hat
  - Sunglasses
  - Gloves
  - Scarf or bandana

### Footwear
Be sure to choose footwear that is appropriate for your environment. In cold climates, wear insulated, waterproof boots. In hot climates, wear breathable, lightweight shoes. Always break in new footwear before a trip to avoid blisters.

If you plan to be hiking in wet conditions, consider wearing waterproof boots.

Bring extra pairs of socks, preferably made from wool, and ensure they are taller than your boots to avoid blisters.

## Shelters

### Choosing a shelter location

When selecting a site for your shelter, consider the following:
- Proximity to building materials.
- Proximity to water and food sources.
- Protection from the elements.
- Free of dead trees and branches that could fall.
- Free of threat from avalanches, rockslides, or flooding.
- Free of insects, poisonous plants, or dangerous animals.
- Suitable for signaling for help if needed.

### Shelter types

You can construct various shelters using materials like tarps, ponchos, or natural elements. Here are some common types:

**Lean-to**

A simple shelter made by leaning a large sheet of material against a support like a tree or a ridgepole. It provides protection from wind and rain. 

1. Lash a ridgepole to two trees or supports. This can be a cord if you are using a tarp or poncho.
2. Lay a tarp or poncho over the ridgepole, allowing one side to touch the ground. If using natural materials, lay branches and leaves over the ridgepole.
3. Secure the sides with stakes or rocks.

**A-frame**

A more enclosed shelter that provides better protection from the elements.

1. Lash two sticks together into an A shape.
2. Place the ridgepole across the top of the A.
3. Lay a tarp or poncho over the ridgepole, securing the sides with stakes or rocks. If using natural materials, lay branches and leaves over the ridgepole.

**Caves**

Natural shelters that offer protection from the elements. Use caution when entering caves, as they can be home to animals or have poor ventilation. Avoid lighting a fire if possible since smoke can accumulate.

**Emergency space blankets**

Wrap yourself in an emergency space blanket to reflect body heat and protect against the elements. You can also use it to create a shelter by tying it between two trees or supports.

**Tents**

If you have a tent, set it up according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure the tent is staked securely and the rainfly is in place. Most tents can be set up by inserting poles into sleeves or clips and securing the tent to the ground with stakes.

**Hammocks**

If you have a hammock, set it up between two trees or supports. Ensure the hammock is secure and the rainfly is in place. Be sure the trees or supports are strong enough to hold your weight.

### Insulation

To retain body heat, you can place insulating materials like leaves, straw, or clothing between you and the shelter walls. This barrier prevents heat loss and keeps you warm. If you have a sleeping bag or extra clothing, use them.

To insulate yourself from the ground, use materials like leaves, straw, or clothing. These materials create a barrier between you and the cold ground, preventing heat loss. If you have a sleeping pad, place it under your sleeping bag for additional insulation.

### Tips

- Use materials like leaves, straw, or clothing to insulate the ground and walls of your shelter.
- Keep the shelter compact to retain heat but large enough to lie down comfortably.
- Position the shelter to protect against prevailing winds and to maximize warming effects of the sun.
- Fill gaps in the shelter with leaves, grass, mud, or other insulating materials.
- Ensure adequate airflow to manage condensation and smoke.

## Repair

### Other methods
If you do not have a sewing kit, you can use duct tape, safety pins, super glue, cordage, or pitch (see the Crafting chapter for how to make pitch) as temporary fixes.
