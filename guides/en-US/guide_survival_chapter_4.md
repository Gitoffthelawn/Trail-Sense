## Food essentials
Most people can survive for weeks without food, but it may take days or weeks to find a reliable food source. Without adequate food, the body and mind weaken, making it difficult to perform essential tasks.

### Caloric and nutritional needs
The average person needs 2,000 calories per day. You should aim to balance carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in your diet.

- **Carbohydrates**: Provides an immediate source of energy and are found in grains, fruits, and vegetables. Aim for 45-65% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Fats**: Provides long-term energy and are used in essential bodily functions. They are found in meats, oils, nuts, and seeds. Aim for 20-35% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Proteins**: Builds and repairs tissues and are found in meats, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
- **Vitamins and minerals**: Essential for overall health and are found in most foods, but a varied diet is necessary to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients.

### Storage
Food should be stored in airtight containers to prevent spoilage and contamination. Do not pack foods that spoil quickly or require refrigeration.

### Rationing


### Starvation
Starvation occurs when the body does not receive enough nutrients to function properly. Symptoms include:
- Loss of body fat.
- Difficulty breathing.
- Lower body temperature.
- Reduced muscle mass.
- Fatigue.
- Longer healing time for wounds and illnesses.

## Plants and mushrooms
The safest method for consuming wild plants is through positive identification. Before your trip, it's wise to study local plants through guidebooks or plant identification cards.

### Foraging

Key considerations when choosing plants include:

- **Water safety**: Plants in or near contaminated water must be washed and possibly boiled to avoid consuming harmful bacteria or chemicals.
- **Disease and decay**: Avoid plants that show signs of mildew, fungus, or spoilage.
- **Toxicity variations**: Even within the same species, plants can vary in toxicity due to environmental factors.
- **Personal sensitivities**: If you are sensitive to allergens like poison ivy, steer clear of similar plants such as mangoes or cashews which can cause similar reactions.
- **Caloric / nutritional value**: Some plants are more nutritious than others. For example, nuts and seeds are high in calories and fats, while leafy greens are high in vitamins and minerals.
- **Animal interactions**: Some plants are fine for animals but toxic to humans.
- **Aggregate berries are generally safe**: These include raspberries and blackberries.
- **Seaweed**: Seaweed that is washed onshore may be spoiled or decayed.
- **Avoid the following** unless you are 100% sure of the identification:
  - Mushrooms.
  - Roadside plants.
  - Plants with umbrella-shaped flowers.
  - Plants with milky sap.
  - Plants with shiny leaves.
  - Plants with white, yellow, or red berries.
  - Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods.
  - Plants with a pungent odor.
  - Plants with an almond scent in the leaves or woody parts.
  - Plants with a bitter or soapy taste.
  - Plants with thorns, fine hairs, or spines.
  - Plants that resemble dill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley.
  - Plants with three-leaved growth patterns.

**Edibility testing**

If unsure about a plant and are in extreme need, you can use the Universal Edibility Test to determine its safety:

1. **Smell**: If the plant has an unpleasant odor, do not proceed.
2. **Sap**: Crush or break part of the plant to check for colored or milky sap. Only proceed if the sap is clear.
3. **Skin contact**: Touch the plant's sap or juice to the inner forearm. If there are no ill effects, such as a rash or burning sensation, proceed.
4. **Lip test**: Place the plant's sap or juice on the outer lip for eight minutes. If there are no ill effects, proceed.
5. **Taste test**: Taste a small pinch of the plant and leave it in the mouth for eight minutes. If there's an unpleasant taste or burning sensation, spit it out and rinse your mouth. If there are no ill effects, proceed.
6. **Swallow**: Swallow the small pinch of the plant from step 5. Wait eight hours. If there are no ill effects, proceed.
6. **Eat more**: Eat a handful of the plant and wait another eight hours. If there are no ill effects, the plant is safe to eat. Have restraint when eating large quantities of a new plant, as it may cause digestive issues.

Note that each part of a plant needs to be tested separately, as some parts may be toxic while others are safe.

### Preparation
Wash plants, then cut up into usable pieces. Some plants can be eaten raw, while others need to be cooked.

**Leaching**
Some plants contain toxins that can be removed by leaching. A common example is acorns, which can be shelled and boiled in several changes of water to remove tannins.

### Preservation
Plants can be dried by wind, air, sun, or fire.

## Insects

### Collection
Insects are a good source of protein, but need to be gathered in large numbers to provide a substantial meal.

Do not eat the following insects:
- Biting or stinging insects.
- Hairy or brightly colored insects.
- Insects with a pungent odor.
- Hairy caterpillars.
- Spiders.
- Ticks.
- Flies.
- Mosquitoes.

Common edible insects include:
- Ants and termites.
- Locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets.
- Dragonflies.
- Bee or wasp larvae.
- Warms and grubs.

Many flying insects can be attracted to a light source at night, making them easier to catch.

### Preparation
Remove the following parts before eating insects:
- Stingers.
- Legs.
- Wings.
- Head.

Cook all insects though any of the cooking techniques in this chapter.

Worms can be placed in water for 15 minutes to purge their digestive tracts. After purging, they can be eaten raw or cooked.

### Preservation
Insects can be preserved through live storage. Keep them in a container with air holes and a food source, such as leaves or fruit.

## Shellfish and crustaceans

### Collection

### Preparation
Clean and eat as soon as possible to avoid spoilage.

Fully cook clams, mussels, snails, and crawfish to kill parasites.

**Note**: Sea birds should be skinned rather than plucked to remove oil glands.

Eat or preserve as soon as possible to avoid spoilage.

## Mammals

### Hunting

### Trapping

### Preparation

**Small mammals**
1. Remove entrails by splitting the belly open and pulling them out.
2. Skin the animal.

## Cooking

### Boiling
Boiling preserves the most nutrients in food and is the safest method of cooking. You can use a metal container filled with water suspended over a fire or placed onto hot coals.

If you do not have a metal container:

1. Find another container, dig a hole in the ground and line it with a waterproof material, or carve a depression into a log.
2. Fill the container with water and food.
3. Heat rocks in a fire and place them in the water to heat it. DO NOT use rocks with moisture (such as river rocks), as they can explode. Use two sticks in a chopstick fashion to move the rocks.
4. Replace the rocks with hot ones as needed to keep the water boiling.

### Roasting

### Baking

## Preservation

### Drying

### Smoking

### Freezing
Once food is frozen, it will not decompose. Freeze food in meal-sized portions. If the temperature is above freezing, the food may start thawing.

### Natural refrigeration

- **Snow**: Burying food in snow can keep it cool.
- **Streams**: Food wrapped in a waterproof container can be placed in a stream to keep it cool.
- **Wet cloth**: Wrap food in a wet cloth and rewet it as needed to keep food cool.
- **Underground**: In shady areas or along streams, dig a hole, line with grass or leaves, and place food inside. Cover to form a cool storage area.
