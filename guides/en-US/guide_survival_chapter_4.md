## Food essentials
Most people can survive for weeks without food, but it may take days or weeks to find a reliable food source. Without adequate food, the body and mind weaken, making it difficult to perform essential tasks.

### Caloric and nutritional needs
The average person needs 2,000 calories per day. You should aim to balance carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in your diet.

- **Carbohydrates**: Provides an immediate source of energy and are found in grains, fruits, and vegetables. Aim for 45-65% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Fats**: Provides long-term energy and are used in essential bodily functions. They are found in meats, oils, nuts, and seeds. Aim for 20-35% of your daily caloric intake.
- **Proteins**: Builds and repairs tissues and are found in meats, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
- **Vitamins and minerals**: Essential for overall health and are found in most foods, but a varied diet is necessary to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients.

### Storage
Food should be stored in airtight containers to prevent spoilage and contamination. Do not pack foods that spoil quickly or require refrigeration.

### Rationing


### Starvation
Starvation occurs when the body does not receive enough nutrients to function properly. Symptoms include:
- Loss of body fat.
- Difficulty breathing.
- Lower body temperature.
- Reduced muscle mass.
- Fatigue.
- Longer healing time for wounds and illnesses.

## Plants and mushrooms

Unless you are absolutely certain of a mushroom's safety, do not eat it. Many mushrooms are poisonous and can cause severe illness or death.

### Preparation
Wash plants, then cut up into usable pieces. Some plants can be eaten raw, while others need to be cooked.

**Leaching**
Some plants contain toxins that can be removed by leaching. A common example is acorns, which can be shelled and soaked in water to remove tannins. Change the water every few hours until the water is clear.

### Preservation
Plants can be dried by wind, air, sun, or fire.

## Insects

### Collection
Insects are a good source of protein, but need to be gathered in large numbers to provide a substantial meal.

Do not eat the following insects:
- Biting or stinging insects.
- Hairy or brightly colored insects.
- Insects with a pungent odor.
- Hairy caterpillars.
- Spiders.
- Ticks.
- Flies.
- Mosquitoes.

Common edible insects include:
- Ants and termites.
- Locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets.
- Dragonflies.
- Bee or wasp larvae.
- Warms and grubs.

Many flying insects can be attracted to a light source at night, making them easier to catch.

### Preparation
Remove the following parts before eating insects:
- Stingers.
- Legs.
- Wings.
- Head.

Cook all insects though any of the cooking techniques in this chapter.

Worms can be placed in water for 15 minutes to purge their digestive tracts. After purging, they can be eaten raw or cooked.

### Preservation
Insects can be preserved through live storage. Keep them in a container with air holes and a food source, such as leaves or fruit.

## Shellfish and crustaceans

### Collection

### Preparation
Clean and eat as soon as possible to avoid spoilage.

Fully cook clams, mussels, snails, and crawfish to kill parasites.

## Birds

### Hunting

### Trapping

### Preparation

**Note**: Sea birds should be skinned rather than plucked to remove oil glands.

Eat or preserve as soon as possible to avoid spoilage.

## Mammals

### Hunting

### Trapping

### Preparation

**Small mammals**
1. Remove entrails by splitting the belly open and pulling them out.
2. Skin the animal.
3. Cut the meat into usable pieces.
4. Cook the meat.

**Large mammals**

## Cooking

### Boiling
Boiling preserves the most nutrients in food and is the safest method of cooking. You can use a metal container filled with water suspended over a fire or placed onto hot coals.

If you do not have a metal container:

1. Find another container, dig a hole in the ground and line it with a waterproof material, or carve a depression into a log.
2. Fill the container with water and food.
3. Heat rocks in a fire and place them in the water to heat it. DO NOT use rocks with moisture (such as river rocks), as they can explode. Use two sticks in a chopstick fashion to move the rocks.
4. Replace the rocks with hot ones as needed to keep the water boiling.

### Roasting

### Baking

## Preservation

### Drying

### Smoking

### Freezing
Once food is frozen, it will not decompose. Freeze food in meal-sized portions. If the temperature is above freezing, the food may start thawing.

### Natural refrigeration

- **Snow**: Burying food in snow can keep it cool.
- **Streams**: Food wrapped in a waterproof container can be placed in a stream to keep it cool.
- **Wet cloth**: Wrap food in a wet cloth and rewet it as needed to keep food cool.
- **Underground**: In shady areas or along streams, dig a hole, line with grass or leaves, and place food inside. Cover to form a cool storage area.
