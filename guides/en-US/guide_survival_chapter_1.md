For hikers, the goal of survival is to return safely from an unplanned situation, such as getting lost or injured. This guide will cover essential survival skills and the situational awareness needed to navigate such scenarios.

## Preparing for survival

### Understanding isolation

Isolation, in the context of hiking, refers to being separated from your group or trail and finding yourself in a situation where you must rely on your skills to survive. Preparation is key. Knowing how to stay safe, find food and water, treat injuries, and navigate back to safety is crucial.

### Core survival skills

There are four main survival skills every hiker should be familiar with:

1. **Protection**: This includes building shelters, starting fires, and staying warm.
2. **Sustenance**: Knowing how to find and prepare food and water in the wild.
3. **Survival medicine**: Providing first aid and managing health issues in a remote setting.
4. **Navigation**: Using a map, compass, GPS, or natural indicators to find your way.

These skills should be practiced and refined before heading into the wilderness.

## Psychological resilience

### The will to survive

Survival is not just about physical skillsâ€”mental attitude is crucial. The desire to survive can be the difference between life and death.
